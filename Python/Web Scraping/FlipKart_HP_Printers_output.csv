0,25-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"PROs: 1. Got reasonable discount of 1600 Rs on common MRP of 9700. 2. Build quality is ok, not great. Top cover is sturdy. 3. Look is great, has a sleek build. 4. Very easy Wireless setup, from the printer as well as from software. 5. Direct print from SD card. 6. 2.6 inches LCD panel with every human intervention operation depicted as animated videos. 7. Input and output both from front side. So one does not have to reach for the papers in case the printer is kept at the middle or bottom rack of a computer table. 8. Cannot comment on the durability, but the colour reproduction in the printed photo is good. 9. Easy troubleshooting in case of paper jam.  CONs: 1. Not at all cost effective for photo printing. I exhausted my tri-colour cartridge after printing just over 20 nos 4x6 inches photos.This turns out to be a WHOPPING Rs. 25 per photo, excluding the paper cost!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Decided not to do any more photo printing unless on urgency. Printing at the commercial printers at the colour labs in the market are way way more efficient than this (just Rs. 6 per photo). 2. The photos come out as much darker than what is seen on the computer's LCD monitor. Even after reducing my monitor's brightness from 80 to 45, the printed photos seemed darker than they are seen on the screen. 3. Although the spec claims the print speed is 25 seconds for colour photos, this is highly inaccurate in real world. Each and every 4x6 photo i printed from my digicam took not less than 55 seconds. 4. B&W A4 printing also took 20 seconds, more than expected. 5. Warm up and motor driving the papers also take time. 6. Plastic build at the bottom and the tray does not impress. 7. My sturdy wooden computer table, which holds 2 desktop CPUs, keeps on shaking during printer operation. 8. Shutdown takes around 7-8 seconds, which I consider long for a printer of this much price.  It does what it is supposed to do, and not exceptional. Overall it turned out to be a okay buy for me."
1,15-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Pros:  Print qiality, ePrint, wireless print etc all work really well.   Cons The printing cost is quite high if you go for genuine ink. The scan to email is not so great."
2,30-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Very handy. near perfect printing. And awesome service by Flipkart. Overall i loved the experience of buying the product.   About the product. I liked the touch screen configuration and the software is really great.   I chose this project over HP 3545, for its touch screen and internal memory(128mb vs 32mb)."
3,05-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"The product meets all expectations for a home printer.  The printer is user friendly, with good print quality and a great scanner. Have tested the wireless feature and it works great too. All installation drivers are also available online on the HP website- makes it easy to install for on laptops without a CD drive like mine!  Definitely recommended."

5,08-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Wounder full printer. Bit costly but it pays. you can print from any where from any wi fi enable equipment. Low cost. Who need low cost printing and want to pring from number of equipment including Smart Phone, should buy."
6,15-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I bought this on Flipkart's Big Billion Day for just Rs 7.  The product is everything that has been described. It's user friendly, and easy to operate. Wireless printing using wireless direct feature is great and makes it simple to print via tablets and phones. Scanner and copier functions are just as good too.   Definitely recommend buying it. And for the amount that i got it for, its a steal!! ;)"
7,15-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,After my Last Printer HP K209A-J this printer is a HP scam. Gobles up Ink Refils and does not even print Excell Lines in Exell Sheets properly. Don't Buy HP Ink Disadvantage Scam. This printer will last but the refills will make you broke!!!!
8,21-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT 1 DAY AGO. EVERYTHING ARE STOP WORKING AFTER SOME TIME. HP BRAND IS NOT GOOD FOR PRINTER. TAKE ON YOUR RISK.AND SERVICE SUPPORT IS VERY BAD. DON,T BUY THIS. I FEEL VERY BAD TO BUY THIS NOW."
9,10-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Works brilliantly. I was surprised that it is extremely fast and also works well on ipad and iphone also. surely a buy .
10,03-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Worth of money and excellent product for those who are looking for home purpose. Delivered on time and easy to claim the offer from HP  .
11,02-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,The product is good but after using for few months is button has loosened.. and few more mechanism sound are coming while printing is on process though it is ignorable and not a big factor. Wireless is too good.
12,24-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,This Is The Best Printer I Have Ever Used. Very Good Connectivity. Scan Saved To Memory Card. Small Screen To View. Overall very Nice For Official And Home Use. Value For Money.
13,22-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,"Dificult to set up wifi connectivity and input & output try carries very less papers., scanner is very good.. Print the documents very slow. If you need wifi feature in printer then u can buy this otherwise HP 2520 would be better."
14,22-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Been using it only for 2-3 hours but first impression is good. Good for home use. Prints and Scans from smart phone perfectly.
15,18-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,i Have used 2 weeks but will see long term usage ... about their post service and durability of product ...
16,02-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"After All the News about people saying that flipkart didnt fulfill its promise on the Big Sale Day, I stand as an eyewitness to the Contrary.  I got this amazing Machine for Just 7 Rs.   Now the Review Good Product and above all its very sturdy. I have a kind of virtual off in my own home and a 2 1/2 year daughter as well who explores every thing. So i have to keep on shifting the printer post usage back into our storage in the Bed. Nevertheless the product had to face occasions of taking a hit here and there, but amazingly the plastic quality is good and its still intact in one piece  Its a good color printer and scanner.   I haven't tested yet how it functions on the WiFi but over all its a good product"
17,21-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I got the product just in a day its awesome. The Scanning and printing quality is amazing but the ink gets to be ended little past apart from that everything is great  ...."" the product worths for the amount u pay""....."
18,16-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"Flipkart delivered it within time but the printer has a small crack on the edge !!  Picture quality is decent with the printer and copying is also fine. However, Scanner has a problem. Sometimes, it scans only a small portion of A4 page that too in zoomed in font sizes. I don't know what's wrong with it. I am facing this issue with 3/10 times atleast. Also, if you try to scan two documents consecutively and store it onto ur computer, it will fail once on the second document and will succeed on simply retrying !  I do not recommend this product."
19,09-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"I have ordered HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in One wireless printer on 07th January & I was extremely thrilled to receive the printer the next day itself. Kudos to Flipkart for delivering the product in no time.   But to my huge disappointment when I had opened the carton, I found the ""power cord"" missing. So all my happiness of receiving the product in a day's time was completely destroyed. I wish the packaging team of Flipkart should have ensured that everything inside the box is there as specified in the outer side of the carton which they failed to do.   So going by my experience, I am not sure if I would recommend Flipkart to any of my friends in future. I have made a complaint to Flipkart & waiting for a new Power cord to be sent home at the earliest."
20,03-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Good print quality and compact design makes it a worth-it printer. As it is with other HP printers, it exceeds your expectation in the quality of printing. However, the touch-console is a bit unresponsive! And the internal processor is quite slow - sometimes annoys you when you are in a hurry."
21,30-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Excellent printer and as usual outstanding service by flipkart!! Setting up printer on your own is very easy. Though it lacked detailed instructions on how to install the cartridges on the manual but it is fairly simple. There are videos available on youtube that will guide you and it is piece of cake. Best part of this printer is you can keep it anywhere in home as it has wifi capability. Configuring wifi is very simple. You can give print command on all devices (Phones, ipads, tabs, computer) connected to your wifi router. Overall I think it is the smartest All in One printer available at this price."
22,30-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,nice printer worth the price must buy product at this price. easy access to it & can print easily through phone
23,26-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,NO SUpport for installation. I bought the printer about 1 month ago and still it is of no use to me. Wireless function is pathetic  DONT GO FOR THIS PRINTER
24,01-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,A very good printer received it safe without any damages and delivery took 4-5 days .user interface is good easy to use all features...
25,28-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"First of all , flipkart service as always has been good.  About the product, the features , initial setup & use are good. However for the proce tag of 8k or 9.5k(original), the build is not great. Its feels so delicate & has to be handled with care.  I dont have any complaints regarding the functionality, its a great feature filled product.  - can we connected via wifi so can be placed anywhere at home. - apps make the connection to printer from mobile easier.  - cartridge original replacement also isnt much costly. - eprint is a welcome feature.  If you can handle safely, this is a good all-in-1 product."
26,07-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,This printer is really great. It offers a lot of features at a very less amount. I suggest this to all.....
27,29-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Printing quality is very bright. Touch screen responsive enough with direct touch interface. Fast booting and shutdown. Ink is very cheap. With photo print as additional feature. One of the best models.
28,18-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"good  best productive.  I would say buy in offers, than at normal prices. wait for it. grab it.  The usage of this printer is highlight as it has wireless printing."
29,12-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,I tried to place order for this printer for two days but to no success as it says that the seller does not ship it to the address mentioned. I tried all the pin codes of bangalore but same result. When contacted to the customer care got ambiguous reply. One said it is a website flaw another said it is a company policy that they do not ship. Felt cheated as I am a regular at the flipkart and still got such a raw deal.
30,10-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I m using it from past 1 monts and its very good and easy to use, best thing is wireless connectivity.

33,28-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"It works very well as expected and the product reached on time.  The paper got stuck couple of times in the beginning but no issues after that at all.  The photographs also print nice but you cannot print it on small photo papers which comes free with the printer, and you need to buy A4 size photo paper for that.  Overall a great printing experience."
34,25-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"The printer/scanner does exactly as advertised.  Issues you will face a. The interface is ""slow"" by any definition. The touch is manageable though. b. Be careful with the scanner settings. Don't set it too high as it will take ages to scan.  One very nice thing: The scan and email option is nifty and works properly. (Wish there was scan and cloud though.)"
35,24-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,IT is very good printer and esay to use it .It is awesomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee printer.
36,05-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"I had ordered HP 4515 Desk Jet Printer from FlipKart. On September 4th I got a message in the morning that I'll get the delivery. No body contacted me, and then on September 5th morning I got another SMS that your delivery has been deferred basis your request. I never asked for change in delivery date, nor anyone from WS retail delivery team contacted me. When I contacted the delivery person Raja at +91-8754428958, he is telling that my number was not reachable through out the day yesterday.   Can I know why neither toll free nor chargeable number of Flip Kart customer care is working?? Why is wrong information being given by Flipkart when they can't deliver the product on time."
37,12-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"this printer stands on its specs, i am proud of flipkart as it always delivers the product before the due date!!!!! the customer service it up to remark!!!! as for the printer, what can you say its ""hp"" people!!!"
38,04-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I received the product in a good condition, even the product is very good and is working at it best as expected. But I am really disappointed with the shipping of the product, it was shipped through bluedart courier but courier guy never tried to deliver it to my office address (which is 24x7 open) given, first day he took the package back after calling me at 6:30PM and refused to reach to the office address and next day also he refused to deliver to my office address and I have to walk one kilometer to receive my shipment, the box weights 6 kg and I had to walk another 1 kilometer to bring it back to my office address which was painful. I thing flipkart should work on having delivery management much more efficient so that customers are not feeling the pain."
39,06-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I overwhelmed with the quality of service they offered. I got the product with in 12 hours after i placed the order. And whatever they promotes in their site is of best quality. I never give a second thought to buy from flipcart.  And the hp Deskjet 4515 is too good printer to write a review. I took some photo print . It was very good .
40,23-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,DO NOT BUY PRINTERS FROM FLIPKART!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY DO NOT DELIVER THEM ON TIME AND AFTER TWO WEEKS OF WAITING THEY WILL SAY ITS BROKEN AND YOU WONT GET IT.....REFUND WAS QUICK THOUGH....OTHERWISE THE PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT!!!!!! I DID NOT EVEN RECEIVE THE DELIVERY AFTER PAYING Rs. 500 DELIVERY CHARGE!!!!!!
41,16-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,This is an excellent printer. Has got lot of useful features and print quality is amazing. For 7.5k this is a good value for money you can get. No doubt you can buy this and won't occupy much of space on your table.
42,22-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I am very much satisfied . you can print from anywhere through HP Eprint Download and print quality is the best in this class printer .
43,13-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"first of all, thanks you very much flipkart for your fast delivery services, the supposed delivery date was 16th May but i got it in two days on 13th and therefore able to register for the hp ink cartridge offer and the product was well packed and preserved(which was my biggest concern as i am shopping any electronic stuff online for the first time). and now few words about the printer. as it is been just a couple of few hours that i have received it, so it will be only based upon my first impression of the machine. - build quality is great - looks are cool and sleek - performance- it printed very well whatever i commanded(though i am just amateur for now and don't want to come to any decision), scanning is great.(but didn't copy anything yet) - one important thing, it is very easy to set-up wireless network(i didn't do anything, everything was performed by the installation disk and printer themselves i just kept on pressing NEXT-NEXT-NEXT-swoooooosh-FINISH. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!!!"
44,07-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Nice quality printer no problems till now. Delivery in days was quite good in 3 days.Well appreciated this product for home and office use for quality printing.
45,06-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Have purchased this HP product from flipkart.com one month back and delivery date was before than the committed date. packing was really good. Web facility still not used.  Pros-  1. Can print without any connectivity with PC through SD card. 2. No back side tray. in and out both are in front side. 3. Copy speed is pretty good. Even draft quality is very distinct. 4. Automatic scanning of only photo from a document is helpfull for faster scanning. 5. Touch screen has given extra man machine interface to the printer.  Cons-  1. Scanning speed in 1200 dpi is very slow particularly for photo. 2. cartridge filling guideline is not clear. 3. Web fetcher could be offered without additional device 4. Could be offered with standard cover to protect from insects. 5. Plain paper printing is in less contrast than screen resolution. 6. User manual is not in detail.
46,20-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"My first choice was Hp. I was looking for something at rs. 3000-4000. But low priced products have a habit of making problem. My cousin was using hp for 8 years. He said ""If you are going to use it for quality work, always go for hp. And go for models priced between rs. 8000-12000."" And this printer has everything I needed. So i bought it. It was delivered 1 days before the delivery date. Well packed by flipkart. And the price was lower than market price. It works really great in both photo and paper print."
47,05-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I just received my printer yesterday and it's functions and performance is excellent. With its wifi function,I am able to print anything from my IPad & Mobile Phone and I can even scan anything on to my iPad or Mobile Phone, the speed of printing is also very fast, even I can print both sides of the paper without even turning the page around. I would also like to mention about the very fast delivery by Flipkart, I received my printer in just 1 day."
48,22-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Printing quality is stunningly beautiful. Scanning too is just fine. However I usually face problem with the connectivity over WiFi.   The printer gets connected to WiFi every time I switch it on, but doesn't show up in the computer. Everytime, have to run the HP PC Doctor to fix this problem. But overall the Printer is amazing."
49,18-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 4515 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"i have been using it for about past 15 days.it is working awsome.  pros  compact and not very big  best print quality takes about 10 seconds to print black and white page and 15 seconds for a coloured one many good features inbuilt like web print,quick forms, WiFi,WiFi direct and lot more scan quality excellent  cons  nothing as of now but ink is consumed much faster as i noticed.  but very good for home use not office purposes.i would recommend it to every one"
50,13-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Got the printer delivered in a day! Thanks FlipKart :):) Good printer, was disappointed when I saw the size of the cartridge (small), I've applied for the HP offer, I hope that I get another cartridge from them :P. Color print quality is too good, but ink consumption is very high (again due to size of cartridge) 15% drained after printing a color photo on to a A4 sheet. Hope there are other ways to refill the cartridge..   Setting the printer up using WIFI was tough (No WPS), had to use the arrow keys to select characters from the printer Display. But if you have it connected via USB, the PC software should help in getting connected to WIFI. loved the Air print feature!!, works like a charm from android tablet.  Cons: Small Cartridge (Less number of pages print out), and replacing cost around 450/-, unless there is a way it can be refilled cheap...  if the cartridge is locked with your printer using the web management console, it cannot be used on a another printer.. I find this a lot disturbing as it would be hard to self recycle the cartridges.. (Hope cartridge never gets swapped when giving it for refilling)  EDIT: Cartridge are easy to refill.. Simply pull the sticker off the top and push the ink into the holes using a syringe.. Be sure to purchase good quality ink!! :):)  Edit: 13/05/2014 I'd recommend buying GoColor HP Premium Quality Inkjet 100 ml x 4 Colours (Dye Ink) Cyan Ink and GoColor 185gsm Photo Paper Unruled A4 Inkjet Cast Coated (Set of 1, White) for best quality photo printing!!   Photo printing quality: Awesome!! Just ensure that you have good photo paper.."
51,11-Dec-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,"About Flipkart I bought this product 3 weeks back. The purchase via flip kart was the best thing i have done.   About the Product The product is very versatile and user friendly. Very useful for home use. Wireless printing option, quick setup are all nice features. However, i find one limitation. Photo copy can be done page by page and you don't have a tray where you slide in more than document to get all copies out at once. When preparing presentations. assignments you tend to copy articles or information from various sources, compile them and slide all these papers to a tray and the output copy is automatic through one outlet. This feature is missing in this 6000 Rupees+ printer. The consumption of Ink is very heavy. I recommend you to buy this product if usage is limited and you print less than 50 pages a month."
52,11-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"I had ordered this printer which came with 3 offers: 1. 10% off 2. Free Cartridge Black 3. Another free Cartridge Black  However post the order was placed, one of the free cartridge was removed on the context of that it was free only until available stocks but i fail to understand:  1. Why the order went through and was accepted when the stock of cartridge was not available 2. How could they remove one free cartridge on the context of stock not available but at the same time deliver the other free cartridge.  Flipkart needs to follow ethics if they wish to remain in market else they will lose the trust of customers"
53,29-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"So I'll Go into each and every first look detail I can get into.  Received this printer today & paid 5499 for it including the next day delivery system which costed me 90rs more. And I have to say that this printer is just awesome. When I first turned it on there was a neat and tidy setup wizard which helped setup the country/region & wifi. The printer can also automatically connect to the internet to download updated firmware. it can very easily print through Google's Cloud print technology as well as through HP's very own ePrint app. Its easy to maintain this printer and one can even close its tray with about 5 to 6 papers already loaded in it, so every time you might want to print a thing or two you won't really need to load papers in it (just sayin'). I've printed the test page and aligned the printer by scanning the very page (the printer told me to do that) and everything works fine. Although I did print only two or three coloured pages with it still the tri colour ink seems to have dropped quite a healthy amount. But then again I guess it's normal. So,  Pros:- 1.) Sleek design and fits comfortably under that small compartment you have on your desktop pc's table. 2.) Is Wi-Fi ready which just makes things a lot easier. 3.) Scans the SHIT out of stuff in an extremely descent quality and sends the scans to either your laptop or to your smartphone (there's an app for everything) 4.) The installation/uninstallation of cartridges is extremely easy 5.) Since everyone would now print over Wi-Fi, the USB cable which came with it can be used to hang your clothes! 6.) Auto sleep feature (Sleep Not Turn Off). 7.) Can also print via Wi-Fi direct which I think is a really neat and noteworthy feature. For all those who don't really know what Wi-Fi direct is, just think of it as the printer's capability to print files from your Wi-Fi enabled devices even if you don't already have a Wi-Fi router at home. So to all those people who are saying that one shouldn't go for this if they don't have a Wi-Fi setup at their home are totally wrong. With this printer anyone with a Wi-Fi enabled device can print stuff. This is basically done by the printer hosting it's own Wi-Fi network and all those devices who would connect to that network will be able to use that printer and everything else is the same. 8.) Duplex Printing allows the printing on both the sides of the paper without having to manually do that. This is an extremely useful feature. 9.) Can accommodate different sizes of paper like A4,A5,B6 etc.  Cons:- 1.) The scanner tray isn't adjustable so thick books etc are so not going to fit in there. It is good only for thin stuff. 2.) The Photo Copy Function, when used, has three Ink Intensity Levels viz. light, medium & dark. Of Course one wouldn't usually use the Dark option but even the Normal option just uses a lot of ink. The light option however, is totally worthless and one could have problems reading the printed output because of it. Only if there was an option somewhere in the middle of Normal & Light. 3.) The UI on the printer's LED is not eye catching, but it does the job. For some it might not even be a con.  All in all, a really nice product and i'm satisfied with it. Cheers to Flipkart! :)"
54,17-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"well to start with its a good purchase over all,  pros, pros, 1. print, copy, scan all tidy and quick 2. wireless is the biggest boon, you can use it from your mobile also(just download the hp app from android market)  cons, 1. ink consumption is a factor,  2. still to find p.s - don't get fooled when they say 450pages on black cartage or 150 on colour, what they mean is if and only if you go on printing 450 pages of plain text that also within 10-15 font size, same for colour. hard learned lesson."
55,17-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I bought the MFD on Day-1 at 10:30 am, the printer was delivered at my doorstep on Day-2 at around 10:00 AM, as I opted for ""In a Day delivery""  now as for the printer, it was a breeze to do the initial setup, and the using the wireless feature, I tested printing using various methods (talking abt wireless because USB/Wired printing is a staple feature).  1. Connecting to the home wireless network was easy using the inbuilt tools. 2. After installing the device drivers on my laptop, it was easily able to do all the tasks wireless as it can do via wired connection. (Printed 2-3 document over wireless worked flawlessly). 3. Installed the HP ePrint tool on my Android phones, and was easily able to print any document from phone.  Point 2. and 3. do NOT require any internet connection for printing, just a wireless home network.  4. I was also able to configure the printer online on HP ePrint site, and able to configure the printer, then was able to send a mail to it and it printed the mail and attachements int it. (There is a limit to maximum size of email and attachments and size of attachments)  Point 4. requires a working Internet connection to work. you can send a mail from office to your printer and your print will be ready waiting for you at home.  5. The printer supports Automatic dual side printing, which is very good in saving precious paper (Save trees and Print on both sides of paper, and print only what you need essentially)  6. The print resolution is great, by using a good photo paper such as from Kodak or HP, you can print good quality A4 size picture to get framed and to put on display in your home.  7. Ink level seems good till now, (after printing about 40 Pages of mixed colors)  8. B/W print sped is quite good, though first page out take a bit longer.  9. Color printing is a little slow (Owing to the high DPI of print resolution I believe).  In all I am quite happy with the product till now, it fulfills all my printing and scanning need, without the hassle of connecting a USB cable to my Laptop everytime I need to print something, I can easily give a print from my couch or bed or table. :-)"
56,12-Dec-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Printer got delivered as usual in 2days, cheers to Flipkart for continued service. I tried this for about a week and then giving comments here. My previous printer of HP C6188 which I owned, had an issue of LOGIC BOARD problem and am unable to repair it, as there are no spare parts in original available. Agencies of HP said, its repairable but no guarantee and that too it would cost 3k. Thought will go in for new and I bought this. Just amazing results on scan, copy, print & photo. I have tried all of them and for sure to say, the ink level just maintains to the level, still I can take 50 prints. No sound, quick in access. When I called flipkart to check whether they have AIRPRINTER portability, no one had even know, what is AIR PRINTER and after explaining for around 2 min, they said blindly ""sorry, not available at the moment"" . I went through HP website and found this wonderful printer and got it for 6700rs. I tested to print from my mobile, ipad, blue tooth connected laptop and desktop....just smooth & best performance.  Kido's to Flipkart for an Genuine product selling. Customer service team of Flipkart, please improve product knowledge skills. This is most important.  V.Madhusuden"
57,06-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,I got the printer yesterday. Bravo to flipkart delivery( one star is only for your delivery service). I immediately plugged it in and i found that the cartridge is getting jammed even when I removed all the packaging. I tried to remove and reinsert the cartridges but no use. so I thought lets see how scanner works. Again even scanner doesn't work. It shows device is not connected.This is the same scanning issue I had with previous hp printer that's why I got this new printer. But I got these annoying problems from the very start I started the device. I was so frustrated yesterday with this printer. This is ofcource not acceptable from brand new product and I hope I get replacement.
58,12-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Bought this a month ago to replace my ageing HP deskjet all in one. It has all the features you'd expect in a modern all in one. Everything works wireless-ly and the setup is smooth - you need to set aside 45 mins for it the first time. Have not seen any downside so far. Flipkart delivery was awesome as always.  But beware the Rs.1000 brand offer! I have submitted the details required to HP on 17th Feb and got an acknowledgement but no word or gift yet! Flipkart customer care is clueless - they even gave me the wrong HP contact number! Please buy assuming no offer exists!
59,17-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"This is a great printer to use and I've had it for about a month now, so I feel I know the ins and outs well enough to review it.  Firstly, it got it delivered extremely quickly - not sure whether it's because I'm a Flipkart First subscriber or due to the efficiency of Flipkart Logistics.  Anyway, it was packaged well and after unboxing it, it took me only a few minutes to turn it on, install the ink cartridges which came free with the printer (this was the hardest bit!) and connecting to my WiFi router (took a while to type in the password).   Secondly, I had to install the software that came with the CD on my laptops and that possibly took the longest time. My printer was recognizable on the network. As for mobile devices, there is an HP ePrint app available for both iOS and Android. Installed it on both devices, and was able to print and scan directly from my phone and my iPad! My, technology sure has evolved since the days of USB printing. The app also includes a few nifty extra features to convert an image to a pdf and also scan from your camera.   This printer is so feature filled, I could probably take up another thousand words and still not be finished! So I'll just list out some of the other useful features and plus points I've stumbled upon:  1. The printer has an email ID - simply type out or attach a document you want printed and it gets printed the moment you hit send! 2. Can scan wirelessly through the interface on the printer itself and send it as a JPEG or PDF to a networked computer. 3. Draft printing mode to save ink and time. 4. ID copy feature to scan both sides and then print. 5. Website interface for when you don't have the software installed - can change most of the settings through this.  6. The cartridge cost itself is relatively cheap and is quoted at 450 pages, which is definitely better than Canon cartridges which cost almost twice as much and give half as much page output. This might explain why Canon sells their printers for so cheap - they recoup the loss ten fold with their ink sales. HP is definitely the way to go with their reasonably priced cartridges.  7. HP and Flipkart each have an offer of a free cartridge with this printer (at the time of purchase) - so in total got 2 extra cartridges free! Although, with HP you do have to do a bit of work in filling in forms and such. Nonetheless, it's definitely worth it.  The list of nifty and useful features is practically endless. So if you're looking for a feature-filled printer which is great value for money, I would highly recommend this printer. The only qualms I have are the fact that the output tray is not automatic - if you leave it closed and give a printing job, the paper tends to get jammed in the printer. Secondly, the software didn't install properly on one of my computers, which isn't a problem with the printer itself. Lastly, Flipkart seems to lack common sense - read below for that experience.   So, I ordered the printer in the evening at 10% discount, and it was on it's way to be delivered the very next day.  However, the next morning, I decided to check out the product page and I realised that Flipkart was offering a free cartridge with the printer for the same exact price! I called up customer care and asked if they could include the free cartridge with my printer as there was no price difference, however they said I could not. It baffles me as to why they didn't allow this. So even though the item was at my nearest hub, I was forced to cancel the order. I placed another order immediately after, and got the printer at 10% discount with a free ink cartridge! Plus, the printer was delivered the same day itself. Kudos to Flipkart logistics, but shame on you for not using your common sense."
60,22-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I had read a few reviews of the printer and was and also had seen other products in the market but was keen on buying this product.  I think in the price range, this is the best printer you would find. Now let me tell you my experience. Initially when i got it, i unboxed it and quickly started the setup The best thing is you get your first cartridges both black and colour within the box. And the price of both the cartridges is Rs 451 ONLY which is relatively very cheap compared to canon etc. IF YOU BUY THE CARTRIDGES FROM FLIPKART THEN YOU GET FREE PHOTO PAPER. The printer supports photo printing feature which i haven't tried yet though. The wireless setup is very easy and it is recommended you set up the printer first, then and then install the software from the CD provided and just once connect the printer from the USB to your computer so that it remains installed. The software will let you set up everything from eprint to the printable apps etc.. Now PLEASE NOTE--- If you do not have a wifi router this might be a expensive and uselles option because features inclusing E-print, wireless, using apps on phones do require a router What you can do without internet is wireless direct feature which directly connects to your computer and devices. But rest options will not work. If you dont have a router you can go for HP deskjet -2545 which is also a wireless printer and available on flipkart too and is a little cheaper but restricted only few features. A option only for people who do not use wifi router. Other wise this peinter atarting from looks to hardware is just sheer brilliance. I love this device and it supports printable apps(not the app for device, that app is eprint app both available on ios and android. Symbian too) The print quality of documents, scanning etc is all great and best for home users. The colour print might take some time. I havent tried photo print yet E print creates an email id of the printer which helps you too send the document to the printers email id and via mail and the printer prints it. Cool feature. And handy too for people always on the go It supports Google Cloud Print too."
61,30-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I dont mind abt flipkart's delivery as I bought it in amazon I know flipkart wont post my review However,my 5 stars are for the product It's a good product which is of a good brand too.Plz do buy it because it is good it is better than other brands like Canon,dont buy canon it's really bad when I went to shops out I found that the catridge is rs.2000 but its fake buy online it is only 476 or somrthing and epson is just like hp slightly, but very costly if u want epson wi-fi printer it starts from abt rs.13,000"
62,15-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,2,"Dear friends, do not go on reviews shown by these people, all this is to fool you. I know flipkart is not going to display my review. This is one of most costly affair for you because its one cartridge hardly print 200 b/w pages and it can not be refilled. One page will cost you around 5 rs. Sincere advice, never go for printers of this series."
63,05-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"The product is awesome, my only issue is why i have not heard back anyone from HP after i had registered for an offer,  I think this is misleading and i don't like this kind of hassle full of service, i had paid for a item and you should straight up have gave me offer in 2-3 days day, why so much drama..... Thumbs down..... (not for product but for offer claim)  Update: To get offer you have to wait at least 1 or 2 months, finally i got my offer redeemed, Updating from 2 to 5 start rating :)"
64,15-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"I purchased this model for scanning and printing now it so tedious to use it for color scanning. This model does not support color scanning, it yields a color scan with sky blue background, so its totally waste of money if you buying it for color scanning. Rest printing is good."
65,08-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"i too purchased this printer . but think before purchase printer , if you want get pain than purchase this printer. after i look reviews than purchased it but this printer cartridge very small and also if you use kind of pom plate to print than it wont print more than 50 at-least.  if you have office you cant handled this printer because full of time waste . and refilling the cartridge too much get pain and it wont be supporting for printing , full paper waste .  don't go this printer better to take print out instead of purchasing the printer."
66,23-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,I purchased the item from flipkart as a cartridge worth Rs.471 was being offered FREE with the printer by the WSR Guy. The printer and the cartridge was shipped separately. The printer was received in good condition. But THE FREE CARTRIDGE WAS CANCELLED AFTER 13 DAYS BY THE SELLER HIMSELF asking me to RE-ORDER the item.  Friends don't be fooled by FAKE attractive offers given on Flipkart.
67,20-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"Never expected such a cheating from Flipkart. I got a used product. When I tried to take the print out for the first time, the paper got jammed and the print failed. When I checked the paper compartment, Other than the paper I have inserted, I got some pieces of paper from the compartment. Obviously its not good to buy a second hand product for this price. But the printer and its print quality looks good."
68,03-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"I bought this product with great expectations. Its a worst printer. I tried to print a letter head, and the paper never comes out. I tried to print for about 24 times and each time the paper gets stuck and 1/6 of the ink got wasted and above that the time trying to print was wasted. When i tried to print the test page it worked fine, but when i tried to print what is needed it fails. I think it is manufactured to print only test pages. Don't buy this printer."
69,25-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,i am using this product for the past 6 months. main problem with this printer is quality of image printing. it prints the images and photos darker than the original.this i have compared with bit cheaper HP Printer(F380 all-in-one). the F380 prints are better than this printer. i complained to the HP company also.
70,14-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,I went by the the ratings given on flipkart and purchased it. This printer does not print MS documents so beware. Search google and you will find many who are suffering from this problem. HP has yet to address this issue.
71,20-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Hi Techies... I'm writing an Indepth unbiased review of HP3545  I was quiet skeptical before buying this product, but after doing a thorough research I zeroed on this product.  I selected Flipkart as it is the most trusted online portal for shopping and Seller WS Retail is always recommended for Genuine Products.  As expected the printer was precisely packed and delivered in an intact condition with additional box packing from flipkart to avert any transition mishandling.  On Unboxing the Printer and Installing the Printer Software and drivers through the cd(in the box) or online (www.hp.com/eprint/DJ3540) Now Power On your Printer & follow the initial steup wizard on display screen of printer.  If you are not connected to a router but still wish to connect your printer wirelessly to your  Laptop, you can do so by going to (Start/ All Programms/ HP/HP Deskjet 3540 Series/ Printer Setup & Software) and follow the onscreen instructions to connect wirelessly.  Your Security Password will be prompted to you on Printer Display. Select(Wireless Direct). Also Remember to Switch the Wifi on for Printer as well as your Laptop  Still If not able to connect wirelessly run HP Print & Scan Doctor Utility App free with installation cd (also available online) or take help of online hp support videos.  The most common problem you will face is paper jamming which can be resolved by using good quality paper (100 gsm- Recommended) and not to overload input tray. Though the specifications read out 100 sheets in the tray always put not more than 25 sheets to avoid jamming issues.  Always use original HP ink advantage cartridges (HP 678 compatible with this product) for good quality prints.You will be supplied with one set of cartridges on unboxing the box.  To use the HP ePrint capabilities you will need a router though as your printer will need an independent internet connection to print wirelessly through your configured mail. But nevertheless you can still print and scan docs wirelessly from your laptop to your printer even without a router. just follow the steps mentioned above.  I hope I've addressed all the queries and will definately help you in making a great choice."
72,04-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"*Delayed review - a full 9 months after purchase*   My search for a quality (and affordable) printer had been narrowed to 3 options viz. the HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545, a printer in the ENVY series (not available in India, unfortunately, therefore raising warranty/repair concerns) and an equivalent in the Canon Pixma range.   It certainly was hard to choose one over the other - but went for the 3545 rather the Canon because of the cost of consumables. HP's cartridges are a lot more easier on the wallet!   The unit itself looks pleasing - great designing! Set-up was a breeze, and so is the day-to-day the operation. There are quite a lot of electronic devices around me - spanning all possible operating systems (Mavericks, 8.1, KitKat and iOS) - and not once did I face compatibility issues.   Even more convenient when you realise the HP app (Android and iOS) can scan smart over a wireless network!    Fitting/removing cartridges is very easy.   Duplex printing is supported and the print quality is rather good - I did notice in the first few B&W prints that text [in sentences] closer to the margins were more grey than black. Maxing out the print quality setting overcame this glitch.   Colour prints are good too!   There is the odd occasion that two papers are drawn together instead of one; but sparing that extra second or two in aligning the papers on the tray helps avoid this weird tick.    Scanning - colour, B&W - is near flawless!   I've probably used the 'Copy' function almost as many times as the 'Print' - very convenient!    I think I've probably printed all of two photographs (just out of curiosity, nothing else) and the output is nothing to rave about - but decent nonetheless.   Otherwise, the unit works as advertised - the ePrint feature certainly comes in handy.   As noted by other esteemed reviewers, the cartridge that comes bundled with the device isn't generous in volume (given that the unit is ink-thirsty); but that isn't a deal breaker in my opinion.  Overall, a very happy user! And a hearty ""Thank you!"" to FlipKart (and WSRetail) for the safe packaging/shipment and snappy delivery."
73,19-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"ordered it on 17 january and got next day around 4 pm which is quite impressive. flipkart shipment is in quite good condition. i had canon E500 printer earlier, which is faster than hp 3545 printer and use less ink than this printer"

78,20-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,It seems flipkart has raised price of this printer 2-3 time and giving some discount on this. The same printer with company warranty is available on other online shops almost 1200 rupees less.   I don't know how flipkart justifies this.
79,30-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,This is a great product with a competitive price tag and the HP quality standards maintained. Works as it talks and can just blindly buy this Air printer and copier. Its sleek and compact looks makes it a best fit for your home and work place.
80,29-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Great to use.. Cool wireless printability and mostly its features and addition printing options.. Overall a useful printer..!!
81,25-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,The printer was delivered by Flipkart on time as always.  Setting up was a breeze with the very user friendly setup and instructions designed by HP.  The printer has been performing very well providing excellent quality prints in color or B/W. We also printed both sides of the sheet for the first time. This obviously saves paper specially when one is printing a draft or a personal copy.  The wireless feature allows us to print from anywhere in the office within the WiFi range.We can also print from anywhere from the web either directly to the printer or using Google cloud print.
82,24-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"The HP DeskJet InkAdvantage 3545 AIO is a great printer. It is compact, easy to set up and can be used from a variety of places in a variety of ways.   I got this printer from FlipKart after being stuck in analysis paralysis over three similar spec models. I compared them on different e-tail platforms and found the best deal here at FlipKart (Kudos again to them for having the lowest price!). Of the sellers, I preferred to purchase from WSRetail.   The printer is packaged well within the HP box, and packed in a carton by FlipKart. Packing is tight, except for a slight surprise that the wires and two (black and color) ink cartridges are not taped to anything and will fall out when you open the top of the HP box.  I found it easy to set up the printer, but I have done this lots of times before having spent more than a couple of years doing this sort of a thing for a living. There are just two wires to connect: One for power and one for USB (I connected it over wireless, so left the USB one untouched). Note though that you need to open the 2nd top panel (under the scanbed) and remove some cardboard etc and also install the ink cartridges. Remember to remove the TAPES from everything.  As soon as you power it on, there is an easy to use Setup Wizard that comes up on the LCD panel on the printer. Have at least one sheet of A4 or Letter-sized paper ready, it needs to print out an Alignment page and then scan it before it will be ready for use.   As with all modern devices that connect to Wifi, it was a little frustrating to cancel the wifi setup during first boot, go back into the menu and hunt around for the MAC address (I need it to enable devices on my home wifi router). The onscreen keyboard for entering the Wifi PIN and the like is HORRIBLE to use and I wonder how long it would be before the arrow and OK buttons give up under the strain. HP could have simply put in a touch screen LCD and be done with it.  You do not really need the software on the CD or even download it from the Internet. Once you have set up the printer on Wifi, simply add it as a Network Printer and your Windows will do the rest. Although, if you do install the software, be prepared for a lot of junk to get installed in the default settings (choose to customize and don't install them). The software that is installed comes with a bunch of handy tools that let you check ink levels etc as well.   I got the printer working using HP's e-Print and Google's CloudPrint as well. This is really nifty and lets you send an email from anywhere to an email address you set for your printer. Of course, your printer needs to be both ON (sleep mode will not work) and connected to the Internet for this to work. However, I found that with both services, if the printer is unavailable, the jobs get queued and are printed automatically when the printer comes online again. Do be cautions printing attachments though as the printer will fail jobs with certain kinds of files (for example, it refused to print my last year's IT acknowledgement sheet saying there were ""photos"" on the page that will not print properly).  Having used other Inkjet and Laser printers in the past, I am happy with the print quality and speed. Do realize that it is not meant for a professional photo studio print or heavy duty printing jobs. For most home users, it is great for occasional document or picture printing and for your kids' project work.  Finally, I am rating the product full marks (5 on 5 stars) because it meets all my needs and as for the things I don't like, I don't expect to use them everyday so I can keep peace with that."
83,24-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Hi Friends,  I would like to say all that this is a good experience since purchasing from Flipkart and getting the delivery.  This is a Wireless Printer with nice features, for a normal user like me who use it once in a week. This will always Print well whenever I switch it on.  print quality is good. Installation is easy. As this have Wireless also enabled, no need to carry a Driver for installation. No difference I found in using connected as well as Wireless.  cons:  Color cartridge is enabled by default. disable it while taking Black and White pages . Color cartridge finished quickly..Till now i took 100 pages and it shows 40 percent left.  But overall experience is good."
84,23-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"First about product: HP 3545 is a great printer. Easy installation and connection (USB+WIFI).  Now about flipkart: Worst service by flipkart. The person comes to deliver package without confirming time, as I was not at home he has to come again. Secondly the free cartridge was not with the package. When I called flipkart they said sorry and arranged the cartridge, but it NEVER got delivered. Its just in my order list waiting for dispatch. I called flipkart end number of times and they just escalate the delivery time. If you don't want to give free gift, why do you keep offers. I will definitely think twice next time before placing order on flipkart."

87,07-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,i haven't got the cartridge as committed . i deeply disappointed the way i got the service. FLIPKART is a Brand such silly things i didnt expected .
88,30-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I bought this printer after reading all the great reviews about this product not only on Flipkart but also on other eCommerce sites; and I have to say that the product really lives upto its review. It was really easy to set this one up as highlighted by everyone. The wireless setup took no time at all to get in tune with my MacBook Air and it worked like a charm; hardly took 10 minutes to set everything up. The scan-to-computer feature is too good and doing all this wirelessly like an office printer is really satisfying.  The quality may not be as crisp as a laser jet printer, which I'm used to due to high end printers at our office; but still this is the best printer for occasional & emergency printouts like when going for an interview & printing out your resume ;)  Overall satisfied with the printer, with the seller and of course with FlipKart :) :)"
89,23-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,"The PC software that comes with the printer is really crippled. The scanning app has a delay to start, and 2 out of 10 attempts, it will fail to start saying it can't communicate to the printer. (I am a network engineer and I have configured the printer and PC perfectly). The ""Scan to computer"" feature never worked so far. The printer failed to communicate with update server as well. (My internet connection was fine)  UPDATE: The update and webservices configuration worked when I tried again three times next day. Still I am plagued by the inability of the scanning application from PC to connect to the printer reliably. It fails randomly. I also get an consistent error in the PC saying that ""Scan to PC""is not activated. So far I was not able to send a scan from printer to PC.   Photo quality - As stated in some other reviews, the resolution is great but the qiality of colors is not great, they appear a bit dull.   Scan - Excellent results. I am very happy in this area.  UDPATE: After some trial and error, I found the reason for intemittent connectivity issue of this printer. Just disable IPV6 in the printer's wifi settings, if you have turned it off in your router. After disabling IPV6 in the printer settings, I tested a 10 page scan and it worked perfectly. At least 2 out of 10 pages would have failed in earlier case."
90,12-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Delivery was awesome, within record time and perfect packaging. I am writing review after I got the first piece shipped to me replaced. The first one apparently has some mechanical problem, and as soon as I came to know about it, HP and Flipkart both worked together to get it replaced. The good part of it was the second piece reached me on the day when first piece was originally promised. So my plans didnot get affected.  I tested printer with some pdfs/word and mht files. mht file did not print as they should have,. Infact there was always a glitch with one particular file and page gets jammed. BUt otherwise I found printing smooth. Wireless option is a relief. You can print and scan too wirelessly. so there is no need to connect USB cable :) Scanning is a page only so if you want to create a book sort of the thing, you need to do it manually on your computer. I bought it for kid's projects and some occasional prints for other family members, seems like this is going to work great. Yet to get an experience of cartridge replacement :) Build quality is something that should be better."
91,04-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I have purchased the printer a month ago and following is the details based on my experience so far.  Pros:  1) 3 in 1 at this price is really good. 2) Wifi, you can print even from Smartphone, Tablet. That's really helpful because now a days we use them more than PC/Laptop.  Cons:  1) Speed of printing, even for black & white, is a bit slower.  2) Color prints are not dry and you can feel a bit humid in print. 3) Makes a bit more noise during printing, annoying when working in a room that's silent. 4) If you try to copy from something with height, let's say a page from 300 pages book, that makes upper shutter a bit opened, you will get black print. To get required result, you will have to make the room dark.  But still good for that budget. You can fulfil your normal needs."
92,20-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Super easy setup and affordable genuine cartridges(Rs.450 each). Impressed with early delivery by WS Retail.
93,10-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"This printer fits the complete need for a home for all printing and scanning purposes, quite perfectly. I got this printer for 5K a month ago (after all instant discounts), and at this price, it is truly an amazing beast. Quick highlights: (1) This is a photo printer - the photo quality is absolutely brilliant. You need to know a bit of photo resolution, ppi, with appropriate trimming etc to get a studio quality output. (2) This is a wireless printer - there are multiple options to get the printer work thru' a router or without a router (thru' the printer's WiFi Direct feature). The print job can be wirelessly fired from your PC/laptop or even from your smart phone. The setup is pretty quick, and in no matter of time, you'll fire your first print job!! (3) This is an all-in-one color printer - print, scan, copy, photo (4) Automatic duplex (both-side) printing - to save paper (5) Takes in a variety of media types - paper (A4 is the max size), photo (up to 280 gsm), envelopes, transparencies, cheque leaves etc.  A few cons: (1) The copy function is one-at-a-time; so you can stack a pile of papers and get it copied automatically. But, this is acceptable, as this is only a home printer and is not supposed to work as one in a print/copy shop. (2) The ink consumption is ok - but that still is too much for a home user. Ink is undoubtedly the most expensive consumable. The workaround for this is refilling :). You can buy branded inks and get to know the filling procedure (using syringes, suction tools etc). Refilling ourselves can greatly reduce the expenditure on ink, but you need to fully understand the nitty-gritties of filling, otherwise you'll easily render the cartridge useless. (3) You need to fire at least a couple of prints once in two weeks to ensure that the inks don't get dried up - this is another burden if you are away for a couple of months.  Otherwise, a great printer. If you ask me, I'd say go ahead and buy this if you've a low-to-medium usage at home. There's no best price - so at this point in time, wait for the price to drop, and buy at around 5K!  Happy Printing!!"
94,14-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,"Not a fan of the printing speed and the noise it makes during scanning and printing. Otherwise, very fascinated by the concept of cloud printing. The printer is installed completely isolated with just a power cord connected to it. It connects to my network wirelessly. I can print through my two Chromebooks or my desktop or even my Nexus 5. I can even scan remotely. I can even print by sending an email to the printer's ID. There are some other options that I have not even played with like scanning over the web and so on.   Ink cartridges that came with the printer are emptying quite fast. I guess they are the demo units with small quantity of ink. Waiting for the regular sized cartridges as part of the ongoing deal. Would see how cost effective it is in the longer run!"
95,08-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,I have not received the offer whereby free catridge will come to me. I have registered for the offer to receive the free catridge in HP website. Flipkart customer care today confirms they cant help in this. Very bad.!! Now I am running pillar to past for the past 4 weeks to get that free catridge from HP as per the offer.  sep2014: I have received the free catridges after 3 months.
96,04-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Photo printing was good on glossy paper. Automatic Duplex printing (both sides printing) is good. Scanner quality is great.  I highly recommend it.  One problem is that I could not make this work under Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I have to use Windoze 7. Maybe a future update of Ubuntu will support this.  updated: I have got the free offer of cartridges worth around Rs.900 two months later :)
97,03-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Well, I just got this product and was overwhelmed with its experience...  The printer's print quality is awesome.  Scans also perfectly  Ink's cost is low too..  Overall a good buy..."

I was able to follow the consignment end to end, Flipcart & eKart service and site update is great... Rating *****  Product is having nice built, easy to setup and interactive menu options. Over all *****  Features:  Print - Nice B&W and Colour print on Normal Paper. I have yet to test it on the photo paper. Copy - Easy to use, speed is good enough for home requirement Scan - Good on the 200 dpi, slow on higher resolution. doesn't matter for home usage...  eprint setup - Not so easy, need to take help of HP website, need to follow steps. Connecting to Internet - Easy...   Over all I can say it's 4.5 from my side, but will give 4 because of change of URLs confuses a lot during the eprintcenter setup."
103,14-Dec-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Recently replaced the HP1050 printer with this one:  Pros - Sleek model, Looks good and dust protected - WiFi printing ability from a fairly distance area - Economical as Ink Cartridge available for Rs.450   Cons - Scan quality is not excellent though good - No printer cover included"
104,26-Oct-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I have ordered it on Diwali cyber sale and i got it delivered after 2 days.It was simply amazing with widi and airprint and even wifi printing .....speaking about print quality is very fine and and no complaints .
105,19-Oct-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Flipkart has delivered on time as promised. Best packing! I got a Ink cartridge combo with this printer for low price.   About the Product -  Pro's - HP has packed all awesome features into one. Sleek design. First class printing near to laser quality, Scans directly to computer wireless when enabled. Wireless direct! ePrint! You name it, it has it all. Photo printing is a breeze with a smartphone.Average priced!  Cons - Nothing so far. May be a little noisy but much better than previous ones."
106,05-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,2,i jus recd ur product today y but unfortunately its damaged....so we would like to get replaced as soon as possible..the scannner button is not activated and hence cause problem...want your response to the earliest.
107,18-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"It is a good printer for home users. Very sleek and the print quality is excellent even in draft mode.   However, the price of this printer is little too steep (at least 20%) in the absence of Fax facility and the ink cartridge price also needs to come down (< Rs. 300).   Even now, the prices of the Cartridges are too high. This is the very reason why people go for refilling, which can be done at much cheaper rates. Otherwise, who wouldn't want to use original cartridges?  As far as the performance and features are concerned, it performs as promised. The print quality is good and it scans true as per the settings. WiFi Direct is another useful feature which eliminates the cable from printer to PC.  Giving 4 stars since price is little too high."
108,14-Oct-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"A great (All In One) Printer by HP. Awesome delivery by Flipkart. Got it in just a day. At this price point, this printer is probably the best. It has got some higher end functionalities like e-print, web apps etc. And the print quality is good for its price point. Has got the option of Auto duplex printing and the wireless sets up in a breeze. However, there are some downsides. The test cartridge capacity is not that good and mine got empty in just 75 prints. Also the Scan resolution is a bit low in comparison to other printers from the competition. HP ink cartridges are really cheap and can easily be refilled. The printer also looks very stylish."
109,01-Apr-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"product is good but i had offer of cartridges worth 1000 INR which is fake, when see delivered item i did not see cartridges offered ones,   then called cc, they are useless and did not able to understand issues they went ahead and put return request on behalf of me :-)"
110,31-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,This is my first review about this printer. 1.The Print/scan/copy works well..  2. Ink cost may trouble you.....  Overall good. ( Suggest you to buy this printer only within this range (5000-7000)
111,27-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Excellent printer in this price. Easy to use, good design, superb print quality, economical. 1. Wireless operation is quite handsome. 2. hp eprint service to print it from anywhere in the world."
112,26-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I bought this awesome printer for just Rs.4818/-, settings was simple, both wifi & usb. Test print done. As usual, delivery by FK was gr8. within 24hrs, item at my door step.   Few things need to highlight:-  a. For printing from android phones, need to download additional s/w from Google play.  b. When I saw the offer on FK mobile app, it showed 3 offers:  1. flat 15% (6299-945=5354) 2. Additional 10% on axis bank card (5354-536= 4818)&,  3. Free HP b & w and color cartridge worth Rs.1054/- (which will be delivered separately on a later date).  Just to confirm the freebies called FK customer care, but to my disappointment, the CC rep says only 2 offers, and no free cartridge.  So, I really donno how all off a sudden the freebies got missed or disappeared.  I'm a FK fan and as such never seen such a mistake.  So either the CC exec didn't know or I'm wrong. So god help me."

117,20-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I am using this hp 3545 all in one inkjet printer from about 7 days. pros: 1.all in one features is exceptionally good at this price....(6000/-) bucks.  2.hp keeps its promise of satisfied customers.  3. look is equally good as features.  4.print quality (4.5 out of 5),copy&scan(4.5 out of 5),photo printing (yet to be tested)  5. duplex printing & borderless printing is a boon.  6.easy opening of interiors.&paper tray,easy mounting&cleaning. cons:1.big size&weight around 5.5 kgs.  2.print speed of colour print is a bit slow than normal.  3.scanning at high dpi levels (2400 dpi) is extremely slow.though scannig at 200 dpi is fast & usually used for all purposes.  4.small ink cartridge(printed 42 pgs &colour level droped to almost 1/4 th)&for black&white(dropped to 1/8 th) of its initial levels.   5.takes time to initiate when command given from pc.....i.e overall speed is slow(i.e i gave four stars).  6.ink cartridge are costlier.  i would recommend hp 3545 if you are going for a good all in one printer,copier&scanner.it is worth the price.if speed is not a big factor then you can go for it. photo printing on photo paper is yet to be tested by me. performance is good despite its big size.  i will give four stars out of five ......one deducted for its speed &ink cartridge cost.   as always delivery was well packed......goodwork flipkart......"
118,19-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Its a good wireless printer and definitely Value for money.  Using it or 6 month and has not had any problem yet. Its quite easy to set (even without installation CD) and its pleasant to use. It catches wi fi network without issues and has useful functions as printing templates as a calendar and so on.  I would recommend it to users who knows how to refill cartridge (or find out online) as its quite expensive to buy it.  The only one irritating part is the printer trying to print adjustment page every time you take out cartridge
119,18-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"today i got the product flipkart service is excellent , printer is working fine and only problem is consuming ink more comparing to others other than that every thing is awesome , one of the best printers."
120,16-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,I bought the HP 802 Small Black Ink Cartridge (Black Ink) - Rs 501 from flipkart with the HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE 3545 ALL-IN-ONE WIRELESS PRINTER (BLACK). Now when I have tried to replace the cartrige with the empty one printer prompts that this is not a compatiable cartrige for this printer. I want to know if this cartrige is not the compatible one why Flipkart has offered this incompatible cartrige with the HP DESKJET INK ADVANTAGE 3545 ALL-IN-ONE WIRELESS PRINTER.
121,12-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,A very good printer in its category. Very convenient to use and there was no problem in setting it up. The wireless feature is a boon as it gets rid of wires. Very quick and easy.
122,12-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I just got this printer from Flipkart for Rs. 5999/-. It works like a charm! I had initial hiccups and my laptop failed to detect the printer via Tata photon Wifi Max. I called up the HP customer care and the customer service is just unbeatable. They promptly helped me configure the printer and now it's easy peasy printing documents wirelessly using laptop and even my mobile. Plus I can just email a document and the printer picks it up and prints it on the fly! Great produt and excellent support from HP!  Well done.
123,10-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Awesome Printer, Nice printing quality, Photo print looks like laser printing.. Perfect solution for home users.

Will update soon on performance after using this printer for couple of days.  Update: i have been using it couple of days & these are my findings: Photos print awesome make sure you use photo paper. Scan is very fast. Paper loading is very easy. Print quality is excellent, be it a black document or a color letter head. ( Dont print Currencies lol)  Over All 5/5 i would definitely recommend this printer."
125,08-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,The first thing i noticed about the machine was its sleek and beautiful the design. Glad that I went for this instead of printers with top loading of paper.   Setup took some time but it was easy and was completed without having to connect the printer with the computer. Scanning can be done wirelessly as well but it requires one time connection with a computer.  The top cover is a bit light and could have been more sturdy. All in all a bargain buy at 6k with 1k worth of ink cartridges free.

135,09-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"this is the smart printer, to be honest it really works well with mobiles but only concern is HP app provided for mobiles is not good ,the reason is we can scan good with HP all in one app but to print there are no selections for grayscale or black or color , what i mean is you cannot print paper according to ur own settings its like everything automatic . but this problem can be avoided by ""HP ePrint ""app ,where u can print with ur own settings , so i recommend use HP ePrint for printing through mobiles and for scanning use HP All in one app ,other than this everything is fine,few complained about printing speed is slow but not really ,those who complained really doesn't know about how to use printer ,to get faster prints for normal texts with black ink u need to select lesser DPI resolution (but this lets the printing quality down),although printing quality is for color printing so i recommend use max DPI for photo,rest all for low DPI it helps u to save ink and printing time ."
136,08-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Product works nicely. Uses HP 678 cartridges.  Only problem is that wireless prints through smartphones are laggy, but wireless prints for PC's are just fine. If you're looking for a deskjet, this one is really good."

144,22-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,I found this printer to be small on space compared to my earlier one. I love the wireless printing and the way it handles printing on both sides of the page. It's still relatively new so I can't say much else.

148,18-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,2,"Great printer from HP and priced reasonably from flipkart. Although I am concerned about one very important aspect. I am a loyal customer to flipkart from many years but this is the first time i received a defective piece for my order. Flipkart replaced it for me and I dont have any concerns with it. But the worrisome part is, once i get a defective piece, I tend to think that this could be a second's product, unless it is a genuine mistake. Not sure which one is true but flipkart has built a good perception among Indians and I personally would like an Indian company to grow bigger against any outsider. But watch out for these defective pieces that you may deliver, it may drive away the customers."
149,15-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I was using HP F2488 series. When I replaced it with this printer, I was really amazed with the new features!!! Able to install the driver very quickly on any PC in the wireless network and print so quickly. I find this wireless printing feature wonderful. Scanning to computer directly from the printer, Auto update of firmware directly by the printer, being able to adjust the size of photocopies and the darkness of the output and especially the duplex printing (automatically pulling the paper and printing on the rear side of the paper).... I am amazed!!! Thank you HP for such a featureful product!!!"
150,14-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Go for it, don't think again. This is a really great printer with wifi. It is really convenient as you can print from anywhere. And the copying function is simply awesom!!!! Flipkart delivered it early too, thanks a lot! This product DESERVES 5 STARS!"
151,12-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Good product but requires refill quite often as the cartridge size is small. Never had any other issue till date..Used for more than 8 months
152,12-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I was comparing three big websites for this product before I chose to go with Flipkart. Why?  Reasons:  1. The layout of information for technical products is very good. So I was able to gather a lot about the product easily. 2. The product cost was slightly better than the others.  Delivery was fast and the product functioning perfectly fine. Used almost 1 month.   Thanks Flipkart.
153,11-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I have been using this product for about three months now and find it to be absolutely useful and as advertised.  Great product and the wireless connectivity makes it most useful.
154,11-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Nice product as usual on time delivered by flipkart . Very happy with the product and service by flipkart
155,09-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I purchase it almost six month ago, and truly this MFP gives me excellent service, and as per my experience this MFN is really functional with ink advantage technology."
156,06-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Two months ago I ordered through flipkart and delivered within 3 days,though it is Deskjet printer, useful for scan, xerox, copy ( Color , B/W) including option of 2 sided print, no. of copies etc., manually, wireless. Even useful for students for their school record / project works. Hassle free to assemble / very easy to remove the paper jams if any while printing. Features like print quality Low / Normal / Dark. one can use Normal mode for all important documents so that can get better printouts."
157,05-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"This is a good printer. Initially I got a defective piece but after complaining Flipkart easily replaced it without any hassle. Print quality is good but ink consumption is high which effectively make printout cost higher. Printing/Scanning speed is ok (not fast but not slow). Can print/photocopy both side with manual intervention. Scanner quality is good. Easy to use. Photocopy, scan, print are feature are easy to use and its wireless feature make it very comfortable to use. Nice printer to have at home. I will give it 4 star (Reducing one star due to ink usage)."
158,05-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Great printer for home setup. The wireless setup was seamless and now I can access the printer through different wireless devices. I would recommend this product.   Flipkart service was prompt and the product got delivered in 2 days.
159,04-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"pro -  print quality is good 1. easy to refill cartridges and even when printer shows cartridge as empty it works fine and do not give unnecessary errors(BEST THING ABOUT THIS PRINTER) 2. duplex feature works fine( please buy good quality pages otherwise page may stuck) 3. printing speed with black cartridge is good and average with color cartridge  cos -  printing gets automatically cancelled some times when connected using hp direct. do not print directly from office( u have to convert it to adobe pdf) problem while printing pictures print pictures darker than they actually are  NOTE - if u don't like refilling your cartridges and think that it can destroy your printer then please don't buy this printer as color cartridge hardly printers 50 A4 pages or 15-20 photos , black will print approx. 300- 320 pages, lesser if print quality is selected as good or best ."
160,04-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"It is a very good practically economical printer with refills costing just over 400 rupees each for both black & coloured. Prints a hell lot of print outs in the single cartridge. The scan & copy function are also decent and are very useful. Just that it is not as effective a photo printer as I've used earlier HP printers (but they used to gallop inks in a few prints) But that's the only sacrifice you have to make for more print outs per cartridge.  And also, it's wireless & double sided printing features are class apart and have helped me a lot in my day to day printing needs...it's the ideal printer for school/college projects at this price point!!!"
161,04-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,2,What is in package is not clearly mentioned. Flipkart must mention such details as well. Will Toner/cartridge is in package or not?
162,03-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Good multifunction printer.Build quality little flimsy . Overall good buy.
163,02-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I have ordered this printer on 1-jan-2015 and received on 2-jan-2015. While installing the printer (as i have did so many times its not a first printer i've used), i got an error ""SCANNER COMPONENT IS BROKEN"". I've called customer care but they told me to wait for their call back instead of helping or taking replace request. THIS IS NOT EXPECTED FROM EITHER FLIPKART OR WS RETAILS. Now am waiting for the solution as flipkart have only 10 days replacement warranty they have wasted my 1 day in scheduling a callback only."
164,02-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Seems good value for money product. Bought it for home use, though have not used much. Easy to set up and get going.  Delivery by Flipkart was amazingly quick. Delivered within 24 hrs."
165,30-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I have to say that this printer is just awesome. When I first turned it on there was a neat and tidy setup wizard which helped setup the country/region & wifi. The printer can also automatically connect to the internet to download updated firmware. it can very easily print through Google's Cloud print technology as well as through HP's very own ePrint app. Its easy to maintain this printer and one can even close its tray with about 5 to 6 papers already loaded in it, so every time you might want to print a thing or two you won't really need to load papers in it (just sayin'). I've printed the test page and aligned the printer by scanning the very page (the printer told me to do that) and everything works fine. Although I did print only two or three coloured pages with it still the tri colour ink seems to have dropped quite a healthy amount. But then again I guess it's normal. So,  Pros:- 1.) Sleek design and fits comfortably under that small compartment you have on your desktop pc's table. 2.) Is Wi-Fi ready which just makes things a lot easier. 3.) Scans the SHIT out of stuff in an extremely descent quality and sends the scans to either your laptop or to your smartphone (there's an app for everything) 4.) The installation/uninstallation of cartridges is extremely easy 5.) Since everyone would now print over Wi-Fi, the USB cable which came with it can be used to hang your clothes! 6.) Auto sleep feature (Sleep Not Turn Off). 7.) Can also print via Wi-Fi direct which I think is a really neat and noteworthy feature. For all those who don't really know what Wi-Fi direct is, just think of it as the printer's capability to print files from your Wi-Fi enabled devices even if you don't already have a Wi-Fi router at home. So to all those people who are saying that one shouldn't go for this if they don't have a Wi-Fi setup at their home are totally wrong. With this printer anyone with a Wi-Fi enabled device can print stuff. This is basically done by the printer hosting it's own Wi-Fi network and all those devices who would connect to that network will be able to use that printer and everything else is the same. 8.) Duplex Printing allows the printing on both the sides of the paper without having to manually do that. This is an extremely useful feature. 9.) Can accommodate different sizes of paper like A4,A5,B6 etc.  Cons:- 1.) The scanner tray isn't adjustable so thick books etc are so not going to fit in there. It is good only for thin stuff. 2.) The Photo Copy Function, when used, has three Ink Intensity Levels viz. light, medium & dark. Of Course one wouldn't usually use the Dark option but even the Normal option just uses a lot of ink. The light option however, is totally worthless and one could have problems reading the printed output because of it. Only if there was an option somewhere in the middle of Normal & Light. 3.) The UI on the printer's LED is not eye catching, but it does the job. For some it might not even be a con."
166,30-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"excellent print, wifi connect to smartphone, tab, etc feature is fantastic. easy for self installation. MAINLY IT IS WIREFREE...."
167,26-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Received today and have set up and printed color, B&W and scanned document with out problem. Had no problem in setting up the printer. Will give further impressions in a week. The offer of HP slate ( which pops up after you set up the printer) doesn't work.  One of the impressive feature is the printer itself is a hotspot, so you can pair up with printer wifi without the need of router or wifi network"
168,25-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,"Initially it worked damn good. Then there was a point when i had to change the cartridge, after which the page gets stuck and the alignment is not proper even after numerous try. Rest everything is good and it is an economic printer that one should buy."
169,25-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"The printer is easy to install and operate. Great choice for the home users.  Flipkart delivery service is, as always, the best! Reached the product on day-3!"
170,23-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"It is the best all in one printer at this price. If u are looking for photo printing, then this one is not the right one. Good for document printing and scanning."

172,14-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"it is an awsome printer at so cheap rate ,which is only on flipkart.I have seen website of Hp were it is something of, 9000. I have seen product sof cannon in my home but I is not good at all,it is cheaper than a this printer,when you will check detail of it it shows many feature,most you can't understand,they are useless also,so I recommed you this printer"
173,14-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Ordered this on 21-Aug, received next day!  Product works flawlessly. Good quality of output, both b&w and colour. I have used both USB and Wireless options to print. I have also used the b&w and colour photocopy functionality. I especially liked the 2-sided print and 2-sided photocopy technique, which requires no manual flip over of the paper. The printer does a neat trick for duplex printing.  I bought this product to retire my old, Deskjet 840c (which is also still working great). Would have been nice if there was an Exchange offer around at the time."
174,06-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,good product no problem . but the driver are not upgraded . hp good home product. worth of money .................................... !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

177,02-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Its a god printer, the set up took sometime but it wasn't difficult.  To set up the wireless you need to install the driver, connect the printer to your computer via usb and then read the instructions that came with the printer.   It can do wireless printing even if you don't have a home network ( it has it's own wifi hotspot).  The Scanner top cover is a little flimsy but that's how every product is nowadays (personally I don't care about it) The screen is very intuitive and the design of the printer itself is better than it's previous model.   also I got a free colour cartridge (although the offer regarding the use of genuine cartridges doesn't seem to work *can't enter the contest to win the slate tablet*) I suppose this is Hp's way of encouraging us to refill our cartirdges :p"
178,29-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Product delivered on time by ekart. Everything works fine with the printer. It's truly a value for money product. Took a print out of a picture taken from a mobile. Print quality is satisfactory. Have so far used the printer thru Wi-Fi mode only. It's faster and easy to use. Amazing results for printouts of documents.
179,28-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,Help pls don't go for online buying of products like inkjet printers...i had a bitter experience with it...i got t hp deskjet 3545 printer but t catridge was incompatible..

180,25-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I really like the convenience of the WiFi feature. It's convenient that any of us at home can print right from our devices at will, without giving the process much thought. Happy enough with the print quality. Both sides print facility is useful, as is the ease with which a quick copy can be made."
181,25-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Product was delivered very quickly. The packaging was very good.  The printer ordered was the one that I received and I am writing it so because we have seen the complaints of people getting the things which were not ordered. lol Thanks Flipkart.
182,24-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"The main reason of my purchase is to take printouts for my kid's school projects and it solved the purpose! I bought this with 2 offers... 1. Free installation guidance 2.Free Tri-color Ink Cartridge. First one is bogus offer, when I call the number provided it is redirecting to HP customer care, then what is all about the offer? the customer service should be free for all stuffs! However I am happy with the Tri-color Ink Cartridge offer.  I was struggling to configure the wireless printing from my iPhone and I called the customer care but no luck. Then I did a research myself and fixed the problem  When I was reading the reviews I read few things like, this printer will not take color scan and cannot take pdf output...But I am able to do both without any problem  I think it will give decent Cartridge life..this is best printer for home and small-office!  Go for it!"
183,23-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,The product was delivered was very fast to what i have expected. The product was in excellent condition and same as description.  Will Surely recommend this to my friends.

Specially the flipkart delivery is awesome. I order and next day it was in my door when i get up.  I want flipkart do same kind of service in all goods. Some of goods are taking so much time.  It should be deliver like this way.  Hardly should take 1-2 days then it will grow
185,18-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,"Firstly, the product was delivered long after the expected delivery date and then it turns out to be faulty.I would have ignored the small dent on the printer but, there is a technical glitch.Even before i have printed the first page, it's displaying an error message of Paper jam continously.Even after having tried all the rectification steps available on the net it's showing the same issue.  Never expected this from Flipkart.Really disappointed."
186,15-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,the main feature highlighting is the Wireless printing and scanning. The ink consumed for printing is good for an average user. only drawback found is when printing via smartphone it takes a lot of time. The Print quality is decent but not the best. Its good for those who print documents with less color image. Scanning is good and time it take for scanning is decent

189,13-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,I bought this printer 2 months back and Flip-kart delivered it in a day. Don't know if this fast delivery was the reason but the scanner component of the printer was broken and I was not able to scan and copy items. The issue was easily fixed when I called HP and they sent an assistant in a day to fix the issue. The printer is great with exceptional quality (do remember to set your preferred quality to save ink). A must buy for everyone :)
190,12-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Easy installation and superb quality print.hp eprint is available so you can remotely print a document or pictures.All you have to set an email ID for the printer.Then you have to mail to that address as an attachment and your print is done.You can also use the application hp eprint on Android to print from your phone.The printer will create a WiFi Direct network and you have to connect to that network from your phone.It's really easy.

Now about the printer, loaded with functions.. love the e-print option..

192,08-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Hats off to flipkart for their delivery in one day.  Whatever HP claims for this product is very much true in real. Crisp, colored print with more than 20s for first print. After that it just an blink of eye away.  Well for first time users, its very much user friendly and for regular ones- you won't regret after buying it. Its worth buying."

Bought this earlier this month, I am yet to see how long the cartridge lasts, but as of now I am pleased with this printer and the quality of printing. The wireless printing works very well.

Over all print quality is good. It is Easy of use and setting up is a quick issue.  The Wi-Fi feature is really handy and saves a lot of clumpsy wiring needed.   Worth the cost."

206,13-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I's awesome!It's printing quality is very good,perfect for home use,it's scanning is also very good.you can keep upto 30-35 papers and close the lid.There are various options in it like: 1.Copy 2.Scan 3.Wireless Direct 4.Ink Levels 5.Printables 6.Quick Forms 7.Tools 8.Preferences 9.Wireless It's easy and simple,especially for kids and there are other various options too inside these options. Now,the main thing is that: Uses:>>very easy and good (everything's given above) Cons:>>Colour catridge easily gets over like about 140 pages(black and white's good)  Note/Attention:Do not buy Canon type companies,they work really bad and gets spoiled very soon.(many of them experienced) Samsung's also bad in printers,easily gets spoiled without any reason(many of them experienced) Epson's good but very very costly the starting rate of epson printers is 13.699 Can get this printer cheaper in other shops (not websites)in websites,flipkart's rate is best."

Some of the things i gonna say which is not mentioned but need to know specially for us who is going to use printer for the first time...  with one monochrome cartridge i have already printed more than 500 pages for my project and assignments... little bit noisy during printing...its very sensitive don't rush while printing otherwise it has a tendency to paper jam.as it is slow in printing.. and if that paper jam happens it has 4 ways to take out that torn paper from the extreme internal part of the printer without harming it which is a hat's off feature.. its not color saving at all... maximum u can color print up to 50 pages..wireless printing is soooo easy.. compatible to almost all devices..  if you ask me then then i will say plz go ahead and buy this product for your personal use...

213,01-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,I bought this printer in an offer for 5240. But when I enquired abot this product they didnt mention that printer cartridge will not provided with this package. I was totally disappointed when I saw only printer and the power chord. When I called Customer care sales department says that Cartridge will be there and escalated to another department. Later another department said that no cartridge will be given this offer. so many confusions. Now I am keeping my printer idol without the Cartridge. I am very much disappointed with flipkart and its customer care.
214,30-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,The printer is worth the price. It's a bit slow since it's not laser-jet but the price justifies the product. Print quality is good.
215,28-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"Highly disappointed by #HP customer service, i recently bought an #HP Printer 3545 & some scheme going on which makes me eligible to get a cartridge free (due to which i bought HP instead of Canon & immediately coz as usual they say scheme is getting over).  i went to their site to register for the offer, erroneously clicked on the wrong cartridge no (HP 46 instead of 678) & submitted. I called & emailed #HP to change help me change it & their response ""this offer is being governed under strict audit process, and as per terms of the offer, we are not in a position to accept your request for the change in gift items"". What good will wrong cartridge do to me and which audit does not allow errors to be rectified & if #HP has such stringent audit process my request should be rejected for it doesn't match the printer i bought. Totally ridiculous excuses #HP is giving for their uninformed customer service. Further i have written to their escalation team 3 days back & no response yet. Buyers pls. beware this scheme is a con, i have fallen prey to their scheme & pls. be very sure before you order from them instead other more professional & cheaper brands are available, at least they don't advertise such schemes & then use excuses to not give u the same."
216,27-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"This is the first time I am very very unhappy with Flipkart service and commitment to deliver.  I am dissatisfied with the Flipkart customer customer (not reachable all the time). The product never reached nor their customer support was of a help,  There logistics has become pathetic. I waited all day at home and logistic guy never arrived. Flipkart has posted false status for the shipment.  Not sure how the product will look like since I didn't got it.  But I seriously request Mr. Sachin Bansal, Binny Bansal to pay attention to customer else sooner they will loose reputation."
217,27-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,"This is a tremendous addition to my home-office setup. it works like a breeze and very easy to setup. Today is a world of going wireless and with everyone carrying a smartphone, this is an asset for quick printing needs. One problem that I am facing till date: This printer is not a very good Air printer so if you are using Apple products you might face problems printing from an iPad or iPhone. I bought this printer in the month of April 2014 and I am still not able to use the AirPrint option from my Apple iPad. Maybe its a driver issue.... I dont know ... but it leaves me frustrated!"
218,25-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Bought this printer for my house and was fortunate enough to get this for 5300 bucks (Courtesy: Flipkart app). Setting it up barely takes a few minutes and you don't need a PC to really set it up. All you need is WiFi. The whole procedure of creating an online account and registering the printer felt a bit confusing, although It was clear once I read the manual. Overall, extremely satisfied with the purchase. Not to forget, I got the printer in less than 18hrs of ordering (Without one-day delivery service) :D Cheers!   Tip: iPad/iPhone users need to install the HP ePrint and HP AIO remote apps to remotely control the printer. Android peeps can just install the HP ePrint plugin!"
219,21-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"The product is good and i found a bit difficult in configuring it before i could actually use it. But eventually figured the steps to do so and it was smooth then on. The value for money on this product is good, the scanner does make a bit of sound but most of the scanners for such price level do make that small noise..."
220,19-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"I purchased this printer from Flipkart. There is no problem with the printer. It is absolutely fine.   But the problem is flipkart has provided a free cartridge with the printer which will not work with the printer. And they cannot replace or refund or return the product as per their policy since it is free. As per my knowledge, nothing in this world is free. it is always a bundled price.   If it does not work, why do they want to give free?"
221,18-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Does good job in scanning, printing and copying. However ensure that you frequently print the stuff, as in my case black ink got dried up because of not using printer for couple of months."
222,18-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"I bought this product from outside. I have ordered it in flipkart, but the delivery guy was too too rude and behaved very badly. And thts why cancelled my order."
223,18-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"This is my first home printer and I am pretty happy with it. It is handy for the occasional prints/scan and copies that you need to take and not have to run around. The colour and the resolution of the printer aren't exceptional like you would notice in your office laser printers but will pass the grade for documents or school projects. The speed of the printer is also slightly slow so wouldn't recommend this if you are going to print a 150 page document, it'll take forever ! But as I've noted earlier, for the purpose as a basic home printer it is great value for money and good quality."
224,18-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Purchased In July this year...this one is really a impressive printer. Previously i had a canon printer whose printing was although nice but was just not cost effective. The cartridges for Hp Printers Easily available and that too at lower rates.  The Best thing about this printer definitely has to be The fact that it is a WiFi printer. Having 3 computers wirelessly connected to this each one can take printouts independently. Moreover E print Software for mobiles makes it possible to print from Mobiles/Smartphones also.  The Email Id provided by Hp for printing is also useful. You can print documents simply by sending emails to the id from anywhere in the world  Printing Speed is amazing and quality is good for a Home user. have taken more than 150 printouts and still more than half the black cartridge remains.  Scanning and Copying Features also works flawlessly and smoothly. Duplex printing is another plus point  The Only drawback for me were the looks.I feel it could have been a better shaped and designed printer.  Nice Packaging and delivery from flipkarts end also.
225,15-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I find this to be a good wireless printer for home uses and have even printed on photo page. The only drawback I could think up is that color cartridge gets consumed very fast. Wish that would last somewhat longer. Apart from that, there is no problem - being wireless printer it is lying in one corner of the home, prints the documents without much delay ....."
226,14-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I have purchased this product from Croma and using for last 18 months. Quality of printing, scanning etc. are excellent. Although HP claims it as the low cost, HP cartridges are the killer. Within few pages of printing itself the color cartridges will run out of ink. Refilling was not successful with it original cartridge due to the chip in it. HP cartridge chip count the page and shows the message out of ink, even if we refill. So you need to by original cartridges everytime.  Due to the excessive cartridge cost, I have tried to use the auto reset chip based refill cartridge available in eBay for this printer. When used refill cartridge with photo dye based ink, it produced superb image quality. Unbelievably low cost.  So if you are buying this printer, buy the HP refill cartridge with auto reset chip (HP 685) from eBay along with the Photo dye based ink. The refill cartridge and ink bottles (black, magenta, cyan & yellow) cost just 2000 INR but makes the printing unbelievably cheaper. Do not use any ink other than the dye ink, if you want photo quality."
227,12-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,This is an awesome printer. Setting it up was easy. Works on WiFi as well as Wireless Direct(that is it communicates with your computer or mobile like a WiFi router itself and all you have to do is save this connection by entering the security key appearing on the printer's LCD panel). It also prints from mobile phone via the e-print App downladed from Play Store or i-store.  You have to go to the website of HP for downloading the printer software (or use the CD prvided in the Box) and then use the WiFi function (not for wireless Direct)  Two sided printing by drawing the sheet back again. Very good.   Scan can be done to your laptop wireless. Cool.  Copy function- no hassles.  All in all a very good buy if you are printing say 75-100 pages a month.   The deal came with two pre-packed cartridges and an extra black cartridge free.

I think in the price range, this is the best printer you would find. Now let me tell you my experience. Initially when i got it, i unboxed it and quickly started the setup The best thing is you get your first cartridges both black and colour within the box.

238,09-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,I purchased this printer a month ago. I didn't face any problems yet.   HP Cloud print is a feature that I always love to use. I can scan and print documents using my smartphone without having the need to switch on the pc which is great. It also have back to back printing facility which consumes a bit time but is justified.  Ink consumption is high and so not recommended for people having utility for large copies of print.  Color Ink also get depleted faster and page cost is higher.
239,08-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Got what I wanted. Wifi printing was most important along with printing from mobile devices. Giving 4 stars since FK delivered in more than 5 days.
240,08-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,I bought this printer to gift it to my son on his 18th b'day who is studying in Shimla. I went to shimla to attend the party & gifted him this printer & returned back to Delhi next morning. Later next day I got a call that printer is found broken its glass & its hinge. The entire episode spoiled his mood & our centiments with which it was gifted. Now he has to send it back & then the sick replacement procedure.  Flipkart please refund my money asap since I will not be buying anything from you in future.  Please note the same printer was available at Rs. 5400 on Amazon.in but i opted for flipkart considering it more reliable but the end was horribly embarracing for me & my son  Please expedite the refund on SOS basis
241,07-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,i would like to recommend this printer further. this is the one you will always like to have one. i took this from shop. the best feature is this works on wifi. we can command from anywhere with network. very good product from hp.

243,06-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"The printer is great though just for the issues with scanning, the printouts post that is not close to the quality that you would normally would take from a PDF etc. No issues with setting up the wireless network that works seamlessly, have used it for a month now and it certainly delivers in terms of quality, especially the fast draft/economical is fast and way better than what I expected from my earlier printers.  The delivery was definitely great got it on the 2nd day without any fast delivery option"
244,05-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,Never encountered such a horrible packaging of an equipment ... Not sure if FlipKart maintains a quality guidance with its sellers .. The cardboard box was damaged all over and almost damaged the HP packing inside.
245,04-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Excellent product. Easy to install. Easy to use. Easy to setup. Wifi & Hp eprint working superbly. Highly recommended product. However I thought I will get extra set of black and white cartridges apart from the ones included in the box as it is mentioned by the seller on flipkart. HP has an offer going on their website in which u get extra set of cartridges free of cost. However I have not received the extra set of cartridges.
246,04-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"This printer is a gem of a product made by HP. Installation is flawless and butter smooth.

First it told me that it will be delivered by 12th September and after I paid the money, the delivery date changed to 16th September.  I mean the true face comes as soon as money has been obtained.

250,31-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"Flipkart is not providing any warrenty slip or anything mentioned related to that in invoice. Whereas on other online sites it is there. If something happens to this product in a year, you will not have any warrent , if you buy from flipkart. So please don't buy it.   When I asked customer care executive Arpit mitral today on this , he was clearly mentioning that flipkart is not authorised to give the warrenty. I asked him to give me mail that in the warrenty period flipkart will take care of the issues, as flipkart is not giving us any warrenty proof, then he mentioned that they can not write this in mail.  So even after pYing the whole amount for new printer customer is getting the warrenty, so no point to waste our mony , buy the printer from other site"
251,28-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,i used to buy many products from flipkart but its over its one of the most unreliable website and customer care executive don't know anything about how management works here. i got this product on 25th of august delivery was fast as usual but they provided a defective product. When i asked for replacement their executive assured that replacement will take place till 28th august but now they are telling that their technical team will call today. I have been telling them about my issues about getting replacement as soon as possible but now everyone is trying to make fool of me. Good bye flipkart. Never gonna buy anything again and will suggest that never buy an item expensive than 1k from these frauds.

I got a faulty one first but then they exchanged it ! though there was a bad employee as Ekart and he never got to my house and everyday made a new reason ! So I conplaint and then they changed the delivery man and cool ! The Replacement came to me ! Only disadvantage of this is ink cost ! Its Rs.480 for tricolor and prints only 80-120 pages ! and the Black Ink is Rs.440 which prints 800 pages !"

Not something unhappy about as still happy with the service.  The Printer itself was a breeze to install on Windows 7. Works like a charm from Ipad over wireless printing and scanning. Not a fan of the app though as takes a lot of space for nothing!  Color Ink net weight seemed less than the Black one. Not sure if that should be what it is. Overall recommended for home use at this price range."
259,18-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,"1. Printer quality wonderful. 2. Eprint is such a helpful feature. Now I can print on the go provided my printer is connected to the internet. 3. Wireless direct helps a lot to print sitting on the laptop from another room without the hassle of connecting the USB everytime.   Con: 1. Instructure manual not very helpful. My first print information page did not get printed automatically and it was quiet an hassle searching for the printer ID.  2. I am very disappointed with the scanner quality; its not crisp and looks slightly blotted when scanning documents. Photos again are not scanned with good resolution. Inspite of trying out scan in different resolution the output remains same!  3. If you are impatient and looking for high speed printer .. this product is not for you.  In conclusion, if you want a good printer with cloud printing features and are ok with low scanning quality only then go for this product."
260,16-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,This printer offer multiple connection options to connect and print. There is an option to print in draft mode. Easy setup and user friendly interface present on printer LCD display itself. Glad to transact with Flipkart. You guys gave prompt delivery service and nice price too.

263,15-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,If your digging for a printer then stop right here. It has all the required things which a printer needs to have. So I definitely recommend this printer. Given below are the pros and cons for this printer:  Pros- Good Quality  Print speed is good  Good control LCD display  Scanner is very good much better than the scans which you get from photocopy shop  Cons-Fragile parts. Chances of damage while replacing cartridges  High Ink Consumption  As I have two printers now both for home use. One is the HP Ink Advantage(Inkjet) and the other is the Samsung ML 1640(Laser Monochrome). I use the Samsung for Black and White printing and use the HP for color. So since the quality of the print is good I definitely recommend this printer
264,12-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"HI, I have recently bought this printer. Earlier I was confused between cost and maintenance but this printer come up with a cost effective solution . First of all cartridge cost is lower than canon almost half of it. Print Quality, Scan Quality ,Copy quality is good.  For Home use I would suggest this printer."
265,12-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Does what it says and comes with excellent Linux support from HP. My Linux version had the HP drivers & software pre-installed and I had to add only the Scanner driver support.  Print quality at Draft mode is amazing in itself.  Scanned few old photos and very impressed with output at average resolution. Copy mode works well too (tried only B/W so far).  Will update later on ink levels.
266,09-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"It has everything. Print, Scan, Copy, Wi-Fi enabled, wireless printing, Display screen and with both color and B/W printing.

Setup was easy  Bad Points 1. The size of scanned pdf files is too much. I lean like 5 Mb for a single page! 2. Scan quality if just okay 3. Scanning takes quite some time. 4. Colout prints take up a LOT of ink.  I would still rate it 5/5 because print functionality is too good. Check out alternatives only if you need fast and top-notch scanning. Otherwise go for this!"

270,07-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,About Product   One of the best printers in this Range  Offer flipkart giving to their customers are best Nice Design  Awesome performance takes 3 to 4 sec for a printout.  Feature Double sided Copy is great. Wire free Printing a different experience  You can print directly from your phone and above all the cost of Ink Cartridge is Jusr Rs 450 What better you could get :) Collectively a complete package anybody would like to have for their home based needs  About Flipkart  I Trust flipkart a lot every time the delivery of the product has been prompt and before or I should say Much before time the reason is Flipkart and their courier partners  but this time got my consignment 2 days late just because of Ecom express ( the worst Courier partner may be ).

272,06-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"A great product . I was bit hesitant to go for a wireless printer as i was not sure how i can utilize the feature . But to my surprise it was very easy to configure . It can be used as a network printer where the printer can connect to a wireless router ( i have one for my Asianet broadband , belkin ) and your laptop connected to the network can use it . It has a direct wi fi option also which can be used by your smart phone and tablet . you can download hp app and it is very easy to use .Another option is through Android you can connect to this device ( i am yet to try that option) . Hats off to flipkart for the service experience they are simply great , product arrived in two days!!!!!!"

278,02-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Awesome Experience of Air Print. Easy to install instruction with and without routers @ home. I have installed it in my drawing room and gave print command from my HP tablet from one of my neighbour's house and to my surprise it worked very well. An Additional security feature (already in this package) is required to avoid any external print commands from others. Fast printing and an added advantage of HP Photo Creation Software. Creates multiple and easy photo albums.
279,02-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"About FlipKart : ------------------------ 1. I place order on friday night and item delivered by Saturday evening - Thats around 20 hours !! 2. Got this item at a 15% discount, so cost was bit cheaper than all competitors such as ebay,amazon and other electronic shops  About Product ------------------------ I was looking for a printer at home and after studying various brands such as Canon,HP, Ricoh,Epson etc. felt HP will be value for money in terms of price and ink refill, service etc. This printer comes with copy,scan,print and photo printing capabilities along with Wifi. And has E-Print and 2 side printing capabilities.   I Initially started with 1515, then 2545 and finally ended up buying 3545 :)  Pros 1. Very easy to setup, up and running in no time 2. Wifi (Same as 25xx series) 3. eprint - Can print from any corner of the world by sending to printer email id(This is a feature present on 35xx series. 25xx series does not have eprint option) 4. Photo print - 35xx series onwards, dont know what this means, even 25xx printers can print it 5. Uses 678 type cartridge, its economical compared to the ones found on 15xx series(802) Those are costly to print. 6. Got free cartridges ( 1 color and 1 BW) 7. Plug and play on Linux(Ubuntu) 8. Support for 2 side printing(Again 15xx and 25xx do not have this)   Cons 1. It printed 2-3 of test pages in color and Already i see the color cartridge is showing 10% less !! HP Claims around 120 pages on this cartridge 2. Wifi direct option not working ( should work like a range booster ). May be i need to explore more on this.  I will update my review after few weeks to share my feedback."
280,31-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I have received with HP lappi as a combo offer.. The Look was awesome, Portable .... Excellent Wireless performance.. The printing cost is very less when compared with other printers.."
281,27-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"As usual it was really fast delivery from Flipkart, in 18 Hrs.I used this all in one printer for a while & so i am posting my review.  Pros:- 1) Very easy to unpack & install. 2) Its really value for money for the features its offering like wireless connectivity,scan copy,double sided auto printing etc. 3) Print & copy clarity is really awesome even at normal mode. 4) Photo prints are excellent 5) software interface is ok .  6) Print & Scan speed is great for home use. 8) Setting up wireless is very easy on smart phones & PC/Laptop Cons:- 1) Sometimes there is issue with MS office not printing. 2) Its glossy and attracts dust. 3) Ink consumption is bit high & the available cartridges is small in capacity."
282,26-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"A very practical purpose, all-in one printer. My usage requires that I have scanning, photocopying and printing functions available. Add to that the convenience of Wi-Fi, 'print anywhere' options, this makes it an awesome product! Haven't tried the claim of printing through mobile and tablet devices since I have never come across that need.  The ink consumption seems to be very nominal when compared to the other ink guzzling deskjets and inkjets (if you were to believe the ink levels displayed in the printer itself). So if you have a very nominal printing requirement (this is not meant for hardcore printing purposes; go for a laserjet in that case) this is the product to get!"
283,26-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"The print quality is very good, but I would hesitate to print a A4 photo due to high ink consumption.  Wireless works like a charm. I could print from almost all my wireless devices like my desktop, laptop, ipad, iphone etc. This would serve as an ideal printer, for domestic use."
284,25-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I have been an HP Deskjet customer for over 10 years. Over these years I have used about 6 different models of HP Deskjet and I can say that this printer is the best of all I have used till date. The printer is good enough for most of home use cases. Good quality and economical printing. To mentions a few cons (which I really don't bother but listing just for the sake of sharing this information).  1. The startup up time of the printer is somewhat more than all the printers I have used till now. It maybe bcos of more functionalities in the printer and also due to less memory (32mb). The next model comes with 128mb but I think its not worth that money.  2. While printing, the printer itself shakes and it shakes the table on which it is placed also.  3. I guess this printer does not feature WPS. I had to manually enter the wifi password for it to get connected to wireless network."
285,25-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"After reading such great reviews on this printer, I ordered this printer. However, the printer was dead on arrival. It kept on saying that there is a paper jam - even before the printer was setup completely. I contacted the HP support. the service engineer came 3 days after I complained. Upon inspection, he said that this printer is dead and needs to be replaced.  I contacted Flipkart for replacement (btw, I had to wait for more than 15 minutes before they picked up the phone) and they said that someone would contact me in 24 hrs. After waiting for more than 48 hrs, I called up again and again the same standard reply - someone would contact you in 24 hrs. Till now - no luck with them.  It does not look like Flipkart has been professional at all.   I would not recommend anyone to use Flipkart - go ahead and use Amazon instead."
286,24-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,Gud user friendly multifunction printer! Got a deal of 6k frm market and guess wht my works became easy...direct wifi is awesome and scanner is gud quality..but this printer is ink thirst but with proper settings u can save ink and catridge price seems affordable. Best suit for home use with a weekly print of 10 to 20 print!
287,23-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I was impressed with this printer nicely designed, no issue in connectivity.I mostly use mobile for printing .Good HP mobile app, From mobile app we can manage printer it can print ,scan from mobile and you can check ink level by using app .overall satisfied"
288,23-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"My first wireless printer.. Sleek and attractive.. Display quality is basic.. Print quality is nice but wireless printing quality not so good, may be required some sort of setting.. Might be slightly more expensive on cartridge side.. I use it sparingly hence no issue.. Print quality and quickness is impressive.. You simply rely it for your basic needs.. Just go for it.. if your use is 5 to 10 pages per day.."
289,22-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Bought this to address my child's project needs. The idea was to print straight from iPad without needing a Laptop as a go between. I could set up the printer wirelessly just from the tiny LCD screen on the printer. The printer is fairly fast and produces good quality results for home/school use. Its silent and smooth. Prints from iPad, Nexus, Mobile Phones and of course laptops. Apparently one can even print remotely by sending the content to print to a predefined email id as long as the printer is connected to the internet. I have not tried it yet. My main gripe is that printing works fine from ipad only when printed from Google's chrome. For reasons I'm yet to figure out, any picture downloaded into iPad's photos app prints muddy with borders cutoff etc.,  There are absolutely no settings to tweak with iPad based printing (even HP's own ePrint prints only muddy pictures with borders cutoff). Not sure if this is an Apple problem or an HP problem.  Except for that, this is a good value for a wireless printer."
290,21-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Hi I bought this printer from another e-tailer. The product is just awesome. I bought this as I felt it would help my toddler in his studies. It actually does. It's a cool Print/Scan/Copy device that would cater to the home needs. The print speed is pretty good. I didn't try photo printing yet. One of the cool feature of this printer is that it can be configured to host a wifi connection on it own. So you do not have to connect this to a router or through any usb cable. Though I've connected to my router and use the same wifi as my internet for printing as they both are in the same table. Setting up was a breeze. I had watched an unpacking/setup video in you tube and it really helped. If you are looking for a basic printer will multiple capability like scan.copy then go for it. I'm not sure about the maintenance cost/ ink cost as i'm yet to use it to the fullest. I guess it would not be a big deal for home use. It also a small LCD panel which shows the printer status and other settings. Very handy.
291,20-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Nothing new to say about flipkart...as usual they delivered the product in a couple of days.  Regarding the printer...it's an excellent product. The printing, copying and scanning quality is very good. Also, I could connect to this printer from my ipad, mobile phone very easily.  I had to put some effort to install this printer as a wireless printer on Ubuntu (Linux) but once I configured it, it worked fine. However, I still need to figure out the installation procedure to get the scanner function to work.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with my choice of this all in one printer."
292,19-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,It's always a pleasure to shop online with Flipkart. As usual they are doing a fantastic job and i got my HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 printer the very next of ordering the product. I am completely satisfied with the product and Flipkart.
293,17-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I have heard there is a US giant eCommerce site that has better prices, I tried exploring them. However, when I came back home (Flipkart), I felt the product description, the reviews, the pricing was the best here as compared to other portals.   I was terribly confused between Canon and HP, but thanks to the reviews on Flipkart, I chose HP and am happy with my decision at least in the first week. One comment on Printer - Be careful when you lift the base (that has ink etc.). It gets locked so that it doesn't fall which is good. However, when you want to bring the base down, one would assume it will come down slowly BUT it falls abruptly making a BANG noise. I was taken aback when it fell down and thought something would have broken. Hope this helps!"
294,17-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Never thought that flipkart will be delivering the product very next day of order in Mathura. Very easy to use and install. Scan to image is not working properly. Scan to PDF is excellent. Printing & photocopy functions works well.
295,17-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Very good for home use and it is wireless printer so that we can print wherever we want in home  Delivery got delayed for my order. Now days flipkart delivering through their own e-cart logistics, they have very poor delivery service. Instead of e-cart delivery blue dart delivery was good."
296,16-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Printer works well. Wireless and duplex printing options provide convenience. Scan and copy works great. However my black cartridge get damage and not accepting. I have to order new cartridge.

298,15-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I ordered the HP 3545 through Flipkart. I had carried out the usual research of pros and cons. The printer/scanner/copier was needed in an emergency for the teenage son who had to submit his Xth std project. The printer has the advantages of being wireless, easy and simple to maintain and operate. Setting it up was elementary. The instructions are to the point. Print quality (colour/B&W) is very good.Scanner and copier are flawless and suit requirements of home/small office.  Flipkart's website was easy to access. Their ordering process is painless. Their delivery was as usual - before time and professional."
299,14-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Printer works well. Wireless and 2-side printing options provide convenience. Scan and copy works great. Was expecting better print quality and speed. You may have to occasionally realign cartridges to improve print quality.

301,12-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I am very satisfied with this product. The quality of print is awesome and the ink consumption is quite economical. I hope this feedback will help you to close the decision incase of any uncertainty.

I have placed order 7 days back and paid fully through net banking, supposed to get delivery on 8th july. Unable to get the product till 11 th,(with out any explanation from MD delivery). I have raised a complaint, the official called me (after 2 days) today and if I confirm the order then will deliver the product after minimum delay of 4 WORKING days, that too they they will confirm after placing the new order. Frustrated by the delay I have to cancelled the order.The refund will take, I don't know how many days (they have said after 4 days they will 'initiate' the process).   My advice to all, always opt for cash on delivery, if you, at all have to order through flipkat!!"

Every second day i need a print or xerox for which i won't have to wait anymore to reach school and get it done. The moment my paper is ready i can get it printed without a second thought.

312,30-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I bought this printer a week ago based on the previous reviews and cartridge price, earlier I was using a HP AIO C4188 for around 9 years and still in working condition but the cartridge prices comes around Rs.1100 and Rs.1700 for black & colour respectively.  Coming to HP 3545, I understood that it is fairly a new model and the most economical printer in terms of both printer price and cartridge price. The next model costs you around 9K with no extra benefits other than 128 MB memory instead of 32 MB, not sure if is a better build.  Pros: 1. Most economical AIO from the most trusted brand HP 2. Cheapest original ink cartridge from HP 3. Wireless is a great option to avoid messy cables and to share printer across home or home office 4. Wireless WPS & Wireless direct makes connecting it easier 5. ePrint is a great option, it is available for android & iPhone 6. Scanning resolution is good enough for home purpose 7. Paper tray can store 50 sheets at any time and you can still keep the printer closed (in my earlier model this was not possible) 8. So far ink level is fairly trending, after 10 4x6 photos, the colour level is at 80% and black is still full  Cons: 1. Photo quality is not great, colours are dull but the resolution of the print is good 2. Issues with Web enabled services (with Netgear and some other routers) 3. No XL cartridges are available and the size is too small  HP Web Enabled Services Issues:  If you have to enable several web enabled features, then this is a required option. This printer has some connectivity issues with Web Enabled services especially with Netgear routers because of Firewall issues. Even the DMZ does not work, you may have to disable the router firewall but I did not try it either because it will become a security issue.  Try these steps and check if printer connects to Web Services or not:  1. Turn OFF the wireless radio 2. Perform Restore Network defaults from the printer menu 3. Turn OFF the printer and unplug the power cable from the back. Wait for 5 min 4. Reconnect the power cable and turn ON the printer 5. Run the wireless setup wizard from the printer menu. 6. check if you are able to print and scan 7. ""Remove Web Services"" from the printer menu and wait for 2 minutes 8. ""Enable Web Services"" from the menu and wait for the process to continue  This should print a page automatically. If this doesn't work either disable firewall option in Netgear or connect it directly using Wireless direct if you have a Laptop or Wifi in your desktop or buy a new non-netgear router!  Overall this printer is a good buy, looking at the cost, features and refill ink cartridges mainly but NOT recommended for Photo Prints!"
313,28-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I saw this product at different retail outlets in ahmedabad and after somedays I found it at a really cool price on flipkart and so I ordered . working perfectly and was properly packed .

But there is the problem with ekart logistics in house service of flipkart. When I have purchased HP DeskJet Ink Advantage 3545 All in one wireless printer black the ekart logistics is given me delivery of the product one day before of committed date not door step delivery provided the delivery its given Varthur police station road. Ekart logistics delivery boy is spoiling name of flipkart. My requests to all buyers not to aspect delivery if there are not providing delivery in your location.
318,25-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I purchased the HP Deskjet 3545 after much research, comparing Epson, Canon printer models and various other HP models as well.  HP Deskjet comes with copy, scan and print functions, which is targetted for home users. Also, it has a good price to feature set balance. The WiFi feature can be used for directly printing from devices.  I recommend this product strongly for any one trying to buy an MFD for home use."

The build quality is good. All in all a good buy and worth the money you spend. This is not a printer for some one who just wants to print but for users looking for some quality printing and scanning. Keep in mind that the e-print option will require the printer to be always connected and on standby.  Of course Flipkart's delivery was as always prompt and delivered in great packing.
322,21-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Excellent Product !! Worth the price !! 1. Comes with the cheapest cartridges 2. Wi-Fi & Wireless printing 3. Auto Duplex printing 4. Seamless Paper handling  5. Excellent Print quality 6. Best choice for Home Use

324,20-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I am not Techie , i have used laser printer of HP 1020 before . I bought this only after reading other reviews of being great printer in budget .  Pros : All as described by others , you have multiple options of printing output and good speed . Cons : This is the first time am using inkjet at home , have taken few printouts at friends'. The colour ink consumption is simply too much :) wondered why they have given name as Ink advantage . The printer can give you lots of problems (i would blame the OS ) in windows 8.1 . So if you feel there are problems then use it with other OS ."
325,19-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Excellent one day delivery. Product is new and awesome as expected. Thanks for the brilliant service.

329,18-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,I have checked the price in other e retailers they are selling the same product for Rs5300 only.  i am not sure why flip kart is selling for 6400.  Most of the products in flip kart are too high price when you are compare with others.
330,18-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I had been using a hp 1050 since past 3 years, it finally gave up on me, after much research decided on hp 3545, the print quality is excellent had copied a drawing and to differentiate between the two was tough, easy to install and use , cartridge cost are low that saves a lot. double side printing saves up a lot of work of manualy turning the paper and printing one by one. Quite satisfied with it. Perfect for my home use purposes ."
331,18-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Was really surprised on the same day delivery after opting for it.  The product was safe and sound with good packaging.  Installation is as easy as ABC.  The printer is worth every penny with its multi-function ability and the best part of it is ""Wireless"" Technology which lets u print from any corner of the room.  The design and look is elegant being portable in size.  The print quality is good, though the first print is some seconds late but OK for home use.  Overall happy with the product and the service from flipkart."
332,16-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Pros:  1. Very easy to install the catridges.   2. Ink levels can be monitored using the LCD screen.   3. Very good design,especially the scanner cover :-)   4. Printing photo is very easy,and gives good output even if printed in a plain A4   size paper rather than using a photo paper.   5. FLIPKART PACKAGING IS INCOMPARABLE.  Cons:  1.Size is slightly bigger compared to other inkjet printers."
333,16-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Bought the 3545 along with an extra cartridge as per Flipkart's offer. I usually need to print colour/monochrome docs at the economical printing standards. The 3545 is quick, efficient, doesnt make a lot of noise, and all of this over the WIFI network. You need a stable wifi router else network will keep dropping and you might curse the 3545 when its your router's fault. So check that off.  Other wise I recommend this piece to all users who have their purse strings hanging on constraints. I did face an issue where i couldn't send a scan instruction directly from the printer. had to resort to using the lappie to scan the documents but got that sorted by reinstalling the drivers."
334,12-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I bought the HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 printer and what I can say so far is that this is the best buy I've made this year. Best of all, it's a Air Printer as well. Print straight from my iPhone - what a joy! Also very easy to install. I would highly recommend this printer to everyone. Also the delivery was very fast and well maintained. Thank you once again. Great product and great buy..."

In all a great printer to watch. Worth all the money. Very fast delivery. Must buy if one is looking for a wireless printer at a reasonable price.
337,11-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Great range, competitive price and brilliant service. Easy to use and very handy, even my mother (80 year old) can operate it to make copies of important documents."
338,11-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Why I was specifically Looking for this printer was mainly - Wireless - The photo printing - Cloud Printing This printer caters all my requirement. The setup was easy. Within 10 to 20 mins, I could able to set up the Printer on my Wireless Home network. No Connection, simply wireless. I have printed the test page, alignment page and it started working just like that. Even I could able to set up this printer with my google cloud print. I could use the print out from my mobile, laptop, through internet from my mobile. Awesome. simple awesome.  Pros: - easy to set up and simply awesome. - Easy to use HP ePrint, which is the cloud printing service. - Good color quality. the color quality on the6x4 photo paper was awesome. - Wi-Fi connection is a breeze to set up. -The small screen is very useful and also adds to the beauty of the printer. -You can also print envelopes with it. - The best thing about the printer is that you can check the ink levels. - the pages out within reasonable time.  Cons: - You are dependent on the CD supplied for the easy setup. Else you may have to download the full setup from HP online, which I never did. I didn't have a laptop which has a optical drive. so I have to depend on my brother's laptop for that. - The color cartridge consumption is more. I have printed good color quality prints on photo paper. The actual sheet printed on a 6x4 sheets was nearly 120 only."
339,11-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"The printer is just phenomenal....its pretty fast , easy to setup , and for this price its uncomparable....

343,02-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Very very good printer from print quality to build quality. And its a true wireless printer. After purchasing I used it to print around 27 pages with no help of a computer. All the options for printing, copy, scanning is there in the printer interface itself. Very happy to purchase this product.  Speed is also very decent specially black and white. Scan and print (like the photocopy) takes around 3 seconds, and color copy took around 15 seconds.  Wireless printing is very secure too. It connects to your home wifi and can be used as a ad-hoc device. Printing from you mobile or iPad requires no passcode as the device conected to the network alone is allowed to use the printer. Its a very easy and seamless operation. I highly recommend this printer for all home users. Gone all those days where you need the USB cable attached with a PC to do all those stuff. Welcome to the future.  Finally Flipkart. I completed my order at 10am of day1 and I received the printer at 4.30 on the same day. I opted for next day delivery, but I received on the same day. Kudos"
344,29-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Very good experience with flipkart. After so many adjustments and having so many address corrections it reached me.
345,28-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"WIFI is very easy to connect through smart phone, but for PC we need to fix wifi modem, Printer will be very useful, print quality is good,"
346,26-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I'm just not sure how the fancied giant etailers can ever live up to Flipkart. The UI of the site and the UX of the service are just beyond reach - at least for now and the foreseeable future.  Now onto the product, the Printer itself was easy to set-up, though I have an iMac."
347,25-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I got the printer setup just minutes back and it was a complete hassle free experience. Now coming to the printing qualities , it's phenomenal. I also tried to scan and copy and both were so easy. My dad too found it very easy to use and I must say it's a complete family package.  Cons : The machine is a little noisy and the ink levels have dropped down after a few prints.   Apart from these the printer is super cool."
348,24-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Here is my feedback on this product: 1. Very techie product at a reasonable price 2. It took some time to understand the features 3. The best feature is WiFi so no need to connect 4. Single press scan is really nice, just press a button it will scan and then copy to your lapy and then open the image. Very simple.  Initial difficulty: 1. Received the product to able to print 2. Called HP guys, they are very good at service, but said that problematic printer. 3. So contacted flipkart to replace, experienced that flipkart hone contact is to very reliable. Finally sent replacement request via web that was very efficient."
349,22-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"It has been some days since i bought this product. Since I did not have a router at home, i faced some challenge printing wirelessly. Of course it has the wifi-direct option, but i faced some problems using it.  My usage has been very limited. It has proved very useful for scanning the docs.  Many a times it takes 2 papers instead of one while printing, while can be irksome. Paper has got jammed twice but removing the jammed paper has been relatively easy.  The ID copy feature is good for taking photocopy of ID cards like passport, voter id, driving license...Photocopy has option for black or colour photocopy which is good  For the budget, this all-in-one suited my need and still does."
350,20-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"WS Retail gives super quick delivery, very impressed. Printer was intact & super easy to setup and use. The best part is that it uses hp ink advantage cartridges which are affordable. (450 bucks each for black & colour)"
351,20-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,This was the first electronic appliance that I ordered online and it was worth it! the package was carefully taken care of by the packing as well as the product was in the best of states. This all-in-one product is handy to work from home.
352,19-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I bought this for my home use, its really very convenient to use and hassle free instal. its wifi setting and its wireless printing is seamless, I've become a great fan of it.  I've tested this with printing it from US to Chennai and it works seamlessly. Multiple apps by HP on Android devices you can hoop up with and check all the settings up on your phone or iPad.  Scans directly on your device without any wires, simple design and elegant glossy looks is a plus."
353,16-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,No-doubtfully HP is a very good brand for printer.This one is the best of them...I fully recommend you to go for it...don't think very much.Printing quality is perfect and very clear also very easy to use...
354,15-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"This is most feature rich printer-cum-scanner from HP at this price range. It is highly recommended for home usage. As it is wireless, it helps to reduce the number of wires on your computer table, and enables you to print from anywhere at home. There are some problems though. The e-print functionality has not been working till date. Envelope printing is not that straight forward and I had to find a work around for doing it correctly. My old HP all-in-one was much handy when it comes printing envelopes."
355,15-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"After a lot of research I bought this device for my home usage. Impeccable delivery by Flipkart and a SUPER product by HP. Its been over a month that I am using this printer. It is amazingly easy to configure, connect and operate. Design is good and doesn't hurt your eyes. Don't just keep reading reviews, just buy it!"
356,14-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Easy setup, fast scans and overall a great buy. However, the product was advertised with an offer with free cartridges, could never claim this using the link provided to the HP site."
357,13-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Pros Fast printing. Good print quality Not at all noisy WiFi enabled so no dangling wires.  Easy to setup.  Cons No tray to put all your originals for copying .So you have to manually place each paper one by one . Scan multiple pages into a single file only works at 300dpi or lower. For more than 300dpi you need to save each file in a separate pdf file.
358,12-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Excellent product and delivered before time, very satisfied. HP home printers are best. Also I have received the free cartridge as promised by HP during buying. Wireless printing is awesome, no hassle and configured very easily."
359,12-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"The set-up is easy & the wi-fi printing ability is just awesome.  The only thing is that I felt it consumes a lot of ink. After just a couple of prints, the ink level dropped to almost 85% !!! This may be due to the use of fresh inks (out-of-the-box) so little early to comment. But otherwise wonderful printer. You can print wirelessly from your cellphone, tablets & computer through wi-fi.   Certain function(s) work ONLY is your router/network supports a minimum of 2.4 GHz, so check the compatibility."
360,11-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Recently bought it. Till now functioning very well. Earlier I never realized the need of a cloud printer but after buying this I identified that it gives you a hell lot of convenience. I can even print emails directly from my cellphone that too on the move !
361,09-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Dam Good, and believe it flip-kart is the best in delivering the product on time, much appreciated Secondly this printer performance is Super-B, prints photo in best quality, worth buying for its price"

363,08-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"It's been few weeks I have bought this product. It's truly a value for money. The quality of print as well as scan is pretty good. Also, the scanning is almost soundless - I was impressed to see the silent scanning."
364,07-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I got the printer very recently and it was amazing. This is the first time I am using wireless printer for home use. Trust me it is worth it.  As far as Flipkart is concerned this is the 13th product I am purchasing and my rating always stands at 5. Great Job
365,07-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Was doubtful about some features like ePrint, WiFi setup, Ink usage etc. After using it, I say, this is great at this price range. All works like a charm even with Goggle Cloud Print. All I needed to do is to connect it to a WiFi network and navigate through printer hardware buttons. Yet to check the ink usage stats.. printed around 10 pages, level is showing full till now. I'd recomend this for sure at a price range around 5K."
366,06-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"If you need frequent scans, prints or copies then go for this printer. I have wonderful experience of this masterpiece. I have taken 60 scans in single day which has saved my Rs.600 (Rs.10 per scan is the rate @ cafes)  Pros:  1. Wireless connectivity: I am using this printer wirelessly as its having inbuilt WiFi 2. Prints from mobile is also possible thumbs up to HP for that!! 3. Scanning is a bit slow but it is of best quality. 4. Colour & photo prints are also of optimum quality 5. Got free pair of cartridges!! Yeppie!!  Cons:  1. Slow operation than Laser printer 2. Space consumed by this printer is a bit large than others  Its an ultimate deal for me. I will not forget to thank flipkart for fast & secure delivery with nice packing."
367,06-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I replaced my old MFP with this new one and is simply the best WIFI MFP for home use and thanks to flipkart for prompt delivery as usual.

371,28-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,The printing quality is very good. The printer when used through either USB or Wireless is good. The problem is while operating in the wireless or wireless direct mode. Wireless will be an issue for those who are not aware of the technology.

Best part is the all in one printer is wireless and there is no need to any cables and i can print my documents sitting anywhere are my home.

375,24-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,been using it for some months now. the quality is pretty good for normal document printing. just recently tried printing my photos on a photo paper and the output was stunning. it looked as good as that from a studio print. am not sure how of ink it has used up :)  however be wary of HP's terrible customer service on promises of gifts and vouchers. Mine took almost 3 months to reach me and that too after some heavy tweeting about it.
376,22-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,This product is awesome and work brilliantly. The print quality is also very good. Highly recommended for home and personal usage and always prefer for original cartridge for best printing quality.

378,22-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"NICE PRINTER TILL DATE NO ISSUESPrinter got delivered as usual in 2days, cheers to Flipkart for continued service. I tried this for about a week and then giving comments here. My previous printer of HP C6188 which I owned, had an issue of LOGIC BOARD problem and am unable to repair it, as there are no spare parts in original available. Agencies of HP said, its repairable but no guarantee and that too it would cost 3k. Thought will go in for new and I bought this. Just amazing results on scan, copy, print & photo. I have tried all of them and for sure to say, the ink level just maintains to the level, still I can take 50 prints. No sound, quick in access. When I called flipkart to check whether they have AIRPRINTER portability, no one had even know, what is AIR PRINTER and after explaining for around 2 min, they said blindly ""sorry, not available at the moment"" . I went through HP website and found this wonderful printer and got it for 6700rs. I tested to print from my mobile, ipad, blue tooth connected laptop and desktop....just smooth & best performance.  Kido's to Flipkart for an Genuine product selling. Customer service team of Flipkart, please improve product knowledge skills. This is most important."
379,21-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Excellent product. Have been using it for 3 months now and has been serving me well. Prints are very clear and no smudging. Wireless printing is certainly a boon. No issues with syncing to PC. Still trying to figure out a way to use the App mode of printing from iPhone/iPad.   Very good value for money. Picked it up for Rs.6.5k, when market price was trending at Rs.7.5k."
380,20-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I was applying for job, passport etc. and I needed to SCAN, PRINT my educational certificates, identification documents etc.  I was not comfortable in taking my original educational certificates to a xerox shop for scanning and printing, I was afraid that my certificates might get lost or damaged.   And moreover driving in heavy traffic in hot weather to get to a xerox shop in Chennai is a stressful task. By the time you reach the xerox shop your all sweaty and mentally stressed due to the traffic and hot weather. I was afraid that my certificates might get damaged or lost. I drive a bike.  So I decided to never go to a xerox shop again in my life. That's when I decided to buy a multi-function printer scanner. This printer scanner is built to suit home users. It's is perfect for me, I can SCAN, PRINT wirelessly. The ink consumption is less and the cartridge cost is also reasonable about Rs.500 per cartridge.   Now I don't have to run behind the xerox shops every time I need to SCAN or PRINT documents to apply for a job, passport, visa, voter id etc. I can do everything by myself at home.  You can even print photos using glossy photo paper. But I have not tried the photo printing yet. Now you don't even have to run behind photo studios, you can do everything by yourself using this printer scanner.  This printer is a good asset and will save you a lot of mental stress of driving to xerox shops and studios."
381,19-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,I bought this printer by going through many printers and brands. This one is really good. The scan and copy quality is better. Connecting to a network is very easy .Looks good and prints fine...You can go for it if you intend to buy a decent printer at a better price.
382,17-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Nice printer and great value for money. Very easy to setup and excellent delivery from Flipkart. However yet to receive the free gifts from HP.

384,16-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"The printer in itself is good. I really liked the web print feature. The deliver and ordering experience with flipkart was great. However, i bought this when there was an offer to get a voucher worth 1000 or replacement cartridges. I claimed the cartridges and even got a mail saying i will get my cartridges but they never arrived. 4 starts for that else i'd have given it 5."
385,15-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I bought this product after reading through a lot of reviews in various websites including flipkart.com. Once I decided to buy this product, I went to various electronic shops near my place to find out the best price they can offer for this product and finally decided to buy it from flipkart as their pricing was the best among the lot. I received this product on time but the product turned faulty. I gave a call to the HP customer support but they asked me to take it to the nearest HP service center. I was very disappointed and then called flipkart as soon as I read about their exchange policy in their website. The transaction got lot more smoother after this. They happily agreed to exchange the product and I received the new product on time.  I am happy with the performance of the printer so far. It's fast, easy to setup and wireless printing is hassle free. It would have been icing on the cake if it had the feature to scan/copy multiple documents at once.   Overall, I am very happy for choosing this printer and flipkart."
386,15-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,This is my fourth home printer and undoubltedly the best so far. Excellent value for money.  cartridges are cheap and long lasting.  most convinient part is wi-fi printing. no more copying from laptop to USB stick then start desktop then print. Print quality is superb. ANd draft is as good as book print. start up time is very quick and setup was completely auto and took my home wifi automatically. all i had to do was give the password. thats it. It was up and running on wifi printing.
387,14-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I am a hp printer user for past 10 years. The last hp printer i bought was a cheap 2000rupee printer and had a very bad experience(functions properly, ink exausts too fast) with it.And was considering switching to cannon..but went with this one instead since it had great reviews and has WIFI:D. And boy was this the right decision.The printer is extremely quiet responsive and fast.The ink is pretty good as well.So far i have printed like 50 pages and its still on 3/4th of the cartridge.  The wifi printing and scanning is a great feature as well.Now a days wireless technology is used everywhere and this printer is just awesome when it comes to printing directly from my ipad or my iphone.

It is a small a all in 1 printer, does not take much of space at your home."

Registered it for the free gift with HP on 12th Mar 2014 but the free gift of 678 cartridges is yet to arrive. Nobody at HP is of any help. Kindly help!

415,21-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"HP deskjet 3545 is worth your money. The key reason behind my selection of this printer is its wireless connectivity as I have multiple devices in my home and dont want to pull out and plug in the wires to connect.  The print quality is very good. Print from mobile / tab is a surprise feature.  Using the HP account I created, I can send files for printing from my office and it gets printed and ready by the time I reach home.  The all in one feature helps me not to run to any photocopier shop, for an urgency   My little daughter loves this feature, as she wants me to help her do the assignments which requires me to do some photoshop editing at office.  On the whole, if you are already using some basic printer and feel the time to upgrade, this one is the right choice."
416,21-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"A tag of great because this is amazingly fast for being a inkjet printer, print is sublime and nimble. In case of cost of cartridge that usually burns a hole in pocket, this is not the case here."
417,19-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I'm super happy with this printer. Hats off to Flipkart people who took extra care to pack this item wonderfully. Coolest air printer which can be used to print from iPhone and Android too. And even print can be done on the go.  PROS: Everything, plus the vibrant design. CONS: Colour ink consumption is on a bit higher side. And the scanning speed is just a bit slow compare to Cannon but the scan quality is awesome.  The printer of TRUE HD COLOURS."
418,19-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"very gud product...very gud clarity,...the installation setup was easy...easy to connect..the wireless feature is of great advantage...so we can print or scan from anywhere using wifi...thats a great feature..the printing clarity is also very gud...anyway very nic product from hp"

Yes it is a great one from HP. A must in small office.it will adore our office. No hassle of wires.

The blue light will be on indicating the printer is ready to receive orders. Yes -smooth scanning. crisp result.I just scanned a document, and send it to my laptop which was in another room. done! From my Galaxy sent a command to print. done. I gave the new printer email id to my son in B'lore to send a document to this printer in Hyderabad. done like a fax.   copying, scanning, printing, and photo - good results.   Remember you must have a wifi- router!   Ink consumption so far so good-not fully tested yet. but really no idea what the ""Ink Advantage' as they claim , is all about? over all 4 stars"
420,17-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"there was a scratch on area at left side of paper tray.I think HP's quality check department was boozing when my printer was being packed.  Coming to product,its very good but makes a lot of noise.During night when everybody except me is sleeping in my home...if I print something the noise of printer disturbs everyone.....one thing more.....it looks awesome."

423,12-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Have been using this for some time now. And it is very good. i was able to print via android mobile, tab, PC, laptop. Also checked the wireless direct. There were some quirks as well. There is no option to print on custom size paper. Also was unhappy about the embedded web server, which is exposed to anyone within network and there is no security to restrict users.  About flipkart delivery, quick, clean, fast and hassle free."
424,11-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Great for home-based office. No fax but then I never use one anyway. You'll find many options for the type of printing, page set up, sizing, landscape, rotate, etc. The scanner works like a charm.  Pros  Installs fast. The ease of using the wireless was a pleasant surprise. The scanner and copier also are good. I had to scan a document and email it; this gave me options of sending it, from pdf file to a word doc.  Cons  - The color cartridge consumption is more. I have printed good color quality prints on photo paper. The actual sheet printed on a 6x4 sheets was nearly 40 only. The color catridge is almost over."
425,07-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Brought this printer from flipkart. As always item delivered before expected date of delivery. The printer box was packed in a carton with bubble wrapping which I like very much.  Now coming to the review of the product. I am not going to write the specs. Please google it.  a. Printing with black ink : Printed over 500 pages and still counting with a single cartridge. Print quality is very good and crisp.  b. Printing with colour ink: Printed only few pages. print quality good. The printer has a facility to check the ink level. After printing 7~8 pages checked the colour ink level and found it has decreased drastically. Dont know if this normal or a problem in my printer.  c. Scan and Copy: Scan and copy quality is good. It has option to convert the scan into pdf and image format. Really liked this feature.  d. Have not used its wifi printing option yet.  Overall its good buy if you are a home user
426,04-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"The printer is worth a buy. Especially if you want a printer to print your photos. A single color ink will give you about 25-30 maxi size photo print and if you work out the cost for a single photo, it comes to around Rs11 per print(this includes the cost of buying a A4 Glossy photo paper)"
427,28-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Perfect printer for home use. Wireless feature is just adorable. Delivered on time and am satisfied with the service.

And with the HP ePrint App that is available for iOS and Android, it makes this printer even better. Truely impressed.

429,27-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Very fast delivery and well packed. This is a very good product. Print quality is awesome.

431,26-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,The printer is good but the Scanner and Photocopier CCD stopped working within two months of purchase. The customer service of HP is good but what if such problem occurs after the expiration of warranty?

440,15-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Seems an ok product. Nice enough color. Pleasure to use the two side printing feature. The machine tracks ink drying time also. Need to try the color photo paper print feature. I find the HP website track a bit pushy. But technically all features work fine.  Using wireless is great. I had trouble for a few hours because I configured wireless first. That stopped my audio line out. Maybe I had an output limitation. I had to substitute the wired connection as the primary connection afterward. It all works fine now  The color cartridge is draining fast, but am not sure it was because the initial cartridges may be less filled."
441,14-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,well this is not a bad product to have for home printing paper got strucked at begining but now it works as smooth as butter and flip kart delivery is faster than expected

All printing options worked well with .Print quality was also excellent . A good printer for home use. Printer came with the consumables (ink) but no paper ! . It would be good to pack one case of paper as well . Would turn out to be self contained and ready to us .
444,12-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,I'm more than satisfied with the product and its features and had trouble with putting papers in the tray but atlast i found it. The product is very good and user friendly. it's quite useful for home use. I'm little bit concerned about the high price of cartridges.It should be cheaper.  I'm not happy with the delivery from flipkart it took almost 4 to 5 days for delivery in Delhi NCR.
445,12-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Been using to print my kids school work. Was looking out for an laser print machine had to settle with ink jet. Only issue i think it has is slow and noisy prints. ( maybe due the motor that makes the jets run on the line ). I would say i am just satisfied than being thrilled about the product.
446,12-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Beautiful! Flipkart did a great job in delivery as usual. Got a great running cost factor. The ink cartridges are easily available...
447,12-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I purchased this printer after seeing good reviews on flipkart and I am glad that I did so. There was a one day delay in delivering the product , but other than that flipkart was excellent as always in packaging , invoicing and keeping the customer informed at all stages from placing the order till final delivery.  This was my first home printer but was able to set it up in 30 minutes flat .Printouts quality is very good and the first set of cartridges are still doing the job unlike the case where some other users pointed that they dried out too fast."
448,10-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"A very good printer and scanner. Worth the money. No problems so far. The manual should have the wireless printer setup steps included though! Had to call HP service center for helping me with the wireless setup. Overall, a good buy for home use."
449,08-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Have been using this printer for almost a month now, should accept the page print is of supreme quality. The only one flaw I found is the speed at which it prints a unit of paper (say 1 Paper). While printing it seems as if it would take a decade to print the paper. If you all are fine with the speed rest all features including the high end features are awesome."
450,03-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I guess the initial print heads finishes quickly. Anyway I will order the other new cartridges and try refilling the inks. I can prefer it for an small and medium companies.

Even without Flipkart Branch at Bhubaneswar, Odisha, I got delivered in 3 days and the price is very low as compared to other even I am awarded with gifts and many more...  Very easy to install. The wireless printing is marvelous, even it works at a wide range also. The LCD display on the printer makes easy in doing multiple jobs."
454,02-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Recently, I bought this printer from a local shop in Chennai. Initially I was planning to buy Hp 3515-e model. Since, it was not available now, I was planning to choose between Hp 2545 and 3545.Considering, the fact that HP 3545 supports Duplex Printing decided to buy this one.   The printer is very stylish and compact. Its also very slim. The LCD panel provides very user friendly options to copy, print and scan our contents. It also helps us to configure various options and tools. And I wanted to say, the installation was very easy and simple. Initially, i thought it was difficult. The wireless setup provides us to connect the printer and PC through a router and we can the print the contents easily without a USB Cable. I have kept my printer in separate room. The wireless printing is flawless and good. The Hp software helps to monitor the printer ink levels and customize the printing options, which is very useful. The duplex printing option was the ultimate one; it also supports duplex coping too and eliminates the need of loading the paper each time. Copy and scanning qualities are top-notch. One more point, this printer also supports Photo printing. I tried printing several photos on a 6x4 inch photo paper, the quality was pretty decent. The printer comes with a trail tricolor and black ink. Loading the paper in the Printing tray was very easy one.  I was able to scan the pages with wireless feature. Once you scan, you can directly send the Scanned contents to your PC directly. This product also supports Wi-Fi direct and HP e printing.  I guess, this is the best printer available at the market right now with all options and features. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for decent Multifunction inkjet printer. I also received a free Ink (Tricolor and black) worth of RS 950 with this printer from HP, since I purchased the printer in the offer period given by HP. Overall much satisfied with product and its features.  All in all, its worth for every Penny you spend!!"
455,29-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,The HP printer which i've bought in flipkart is amazing. It has many preferences. The quality of print is very good and low cost
456,26-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Bought this printer from flipkart a few weeks ago as the existing HP one seemed to be too big in size.  A very compact printer; which does all the daily printing, copy and scanning activities. Copy quality is much much better than the commercial Xerox copies.

472,17-Dec-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I must say that I am quite impressed with the printer. Sleek design, doesn't occupy too much space and easy to install, wifi works very well and so printing from multiple sources is a breeze.  Also till date have printed about 70-80 pages with the factory supplied cartridges i guess they ll work well for another 100. Highly recommended for home use, cost of print/copy is nominal and is very convenient as the cartridge costs 448 Rs on Flipkart (after discount) and lasts quite a bit."
473,09-Dec-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"This HP thing works like a charm, economical reliable and easy to install and print from the mail to HP is good.   Scan and copy are easy, but the things missed are scan and collate pages to a PDF or we might've missed installing the same.  Our rating is 4 out of 5 ;-) A clean thumbs up !!! Thanks flipkart for a good product."
474,05-Dec-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I ordered this printer on 23/11/13 and got a call from delivery courier on 24/11/13. I requested them to post pond the delivery to 25/11/13 since I was not available at home on 24/11/13. Very fast delivery of very nice product.  I faced some problem installing the printer driver on my win 7 system. Called up HP customer care number and the executive helped my to configure it through remote sharing. He was also happy to provide all the details and explanations I requested about the product and configuration issues.  Very good experience.......
475,20-Nov-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Very fast delivery by flipkart - within 2 days (2 days before the committed date) I have been using this printer for a week. Good printing quality and features especially wireless printing on WIFI that enables printing through mobile phone or an iPAD. Scan quality is good and so is the photocopying quality. Duplex function is very helpful if you wish to save some stationary and avoid manually flipping the paper.

477,07-Nov-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Found the Wifi connectivity and Auto-Duplex most useful. Print quality is good as well. Definitely recommend this product.
478,07-Nov-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Excellent printer for home use. Cheaper cartridges, online easy printing, wireless connectivity makes this a non-brainer.  I have tried to print with my desktop, my laptop (Macbook Pro Retinal) and with my phone Galaxy Note 2. All came out perfectly.You can also print by emailing your docs to the printer (you configure your email address for the printer). You can set Access details etc."
479,14-Oct-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Got this printer a day ago. Quick delivery which is characteristic of flipkart.   Talking about the printer, here are my points: Pros- - classy looks - really good print output - wifi enabled which enables connect to the home group - HP eprint facility, which is a great service  Cons- None noted as of now."
480,24-Sep-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 3545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Hats Off to Flipkart for the fastest delivery.And for providing the best price (Rs.6484) Next the product is the best product launched by hp till now. - Wifi - Printer, Scanner, Copier and Photo - E-print - Mobile print - Low cost Ink cartridge - HP even offers free Rs.1000 TITAN Voucher.(Limited Period).

481,12-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,3,"Choose the correct printer when u purchase, in this it says (Low cartridge Cost) with a cost of 3200rs. the Black Cartridge Cost is 440 rs, pages yield is 120.  the Color cartridge cost is 650 rs, pages yield is 100.  If you go for Deskjet 1515 cost 4600rs Black Cartridge 430 rs, pages yield is 480. Color Cartridge 443 rs, pages yield is 150.  Choice is yours...."
482,18-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,2,"Hello..  This is all or rather maximum that you can expect for the money/price and from a branded company.  It is an all in one printer with scan,copy,print with inkjet ink.  The problem is, on both flipkart and snapdeal; in product features it is clearly states ""Auto Enlarge"" in additional features but there is no such auto enlarge for photocopying nor is there any manual button for enlarging photocopy.  It would have been a straight forward buy if it actually had enlarge option too..  Misleading information provided by flipkart !!  They are not even removing the same from the product description inspite of me personally emailing them several times"
483,09-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,2,"HP Deskjet 1510 is a good printer and I got it for free as purchased a HP laptop from a local shop. This printer came with inbuilt 2 small cartridges(Color & B/W). As I started to use this but within 25-30(Including color & b/w) prints the ink was finished. Now I wanted to buy a cartridge for it and found that HP 1510 printer's cartridge is the most expensive one. Rs.480 for Small black HP 802 cartridge(approx 90 pages), Rs.1200 for Large Black cartridge(approx 340 pages). Whereas other cartridges like HP 678 costs Rs.480 for 460 pages which makes a huge difference. Usually this is a marketing tactics that by buying a low cost printer you end up in buying expensive cartridges,the manufacturers sell these printers for no profits or even loss whereas they gain huge profits on cartridges in these low cost printers. If you are looking for a basic all-in-one printer then HP Deskjet 1510 is OK for very occasional print outs, Better go for HP Deskjet 1515(1.2k extra) rather than this one because the cartridges(HP 678) are much affordable than HP 802 cartridges which are very expensive for the HP 1510 printers. Buy buying HP 1510 thinking of low cost you end up spending more money on cartridges which is quite expensive in the long run.Choose wisely."
484,19-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,1,"Cost of printer is less but the cost of Black printout is more than 4 Rs. per page and of colored printout more then 10 Rs., colored printout with very bad resolution. So it's a bakwaas printer."
485,17-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,1,"we do not have good experience for this. not good it look like a white elephant. we do not like it, we will not refer to any other friend and relative."
486,21-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,1,This is not good printer. I am using this is since couple of months and it's consume lot of inks and that is very costly. so it's my personal request don't purchase this printer.
487,22-Oct-2013,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,Very happy with this product as it serves the purpose.  Pros quality of print(both black and white) is good likewise scan and copy feature adds a feather to its cap. i was able to scan some old photos and it came out well.  Ideal for limited use say less than 50 pages per month. Cons Does not print both sides of the paper automatically. you need to manually place the opposite side for it to print. no wireless connectivity via wi-fi
488,11-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,1,"Consumes a hell lot of ink, ink drains out even before printing 50 pages in draft print settings with original HP 802 catridges"
489,01-Oct-2013,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,"Pros and cons: 1) it is very good for domestic use, but if you are purchasing it for office purposes i will prefer some other option 2) Print quality is good but consumes a lot of ink. 3) Both side auto printing option is not there 4) copy function is the worst- it consumes a lot of ink further quality of copy is also poor 5) price is competitive- i.e., Rs 3100 only"
490,06-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"I'm a little biased towards HP. Having worked in HP tech support for about 4 years and then having made a career in tech support supporting various different printers, I've seen lots of printers and worked with everything from Canon, Epson, Lexmark, Brother, Kodak to HP. HP simply rules the roost and when I needed a easy-on-the-pocket printer for my dad, this perfectly fit the bill. We needed an all-in-one with scanning and prints(1-2 a week) which was affordable and this printer is working out great. My dad is extremely thrilled and I was able to spend some time with the printer when I was home, and it sure is fast when scanning. Print speeds are ok too and color rendition is better than some more expensive printers from other brands. The copy functions are basic but then who makes copies on these all-in-one printers unless really urgent(neighborhood copy wallahs are preferred due to cost). Overall, a neat, no frills printer."
491,05-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,1,I am not Satisfied with this product.. It is because i make one zerox of hundreed rupee note and it used 5-7% of colour ink.. where as i make that same with hp 2515 ink level remains same..  About black print : Not a good quality print and also when i make 80 print and ink level comes to 25%.. where as i make print with hp 2515 it gives 250-300Pages   Scan : It is good but the quality is not too good..  Body : When printer starts it makes noise and for a moment you will think that all material inside the printer will fall down..   I am really shocked that HP is making this type of printer..   And in my way i think better you go out for printing instead of buying this printer.. because the printing cost too much from this printer..   Remember that when you buy a printer see my review.. I have used many printer which good and bad..
492,08-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,1,Printer is ok scanner is also ok..... BUT Ink cartridge are very expensive and have very low output (small black lasted 36-37 pages). Combined cost of Small colored and s.black cartridge is more than the cost of printer(with free small Cartridges). It has an inbuilt chip which does not allow user to use refilled ink cartridge. So you either need to buy a new printer or a new cartridge. Go to some local shop and find out any printer which allows you to use refilled cartridges.
493,07-May-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,3,First of alll Good Service From Filpkart.....

494,18-Dec-2013,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,This is cost-efficient introduction to the world of printing. I liked the product which I bought for the home usage. I would suggest you to go for it considering the features it provides.
495,12-Oct-2013,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,I like this printer it was so fast then other printer it was lower then other printers i will say u to go for it
496,18-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,1,"Flipkart cleared their warehouse by selling this sort of low-grade product. I suspect whether they are bringing the third quality manufactured items being sold on their site.  You may invest a lot in them, but finally these (dishonest)* marketers will sue you with selling you the cheap quality products like this.   The product is having the issues when bought in the summer (April mid, literally). We thought of the hot season might be the reason the ink being vanished from the jet. We waited till the summer going: issue was the same; went with different technicians and all but the suggestion was the same.  I waited till the till passed along because I 'trusted' flipkart : it was the biggest mistake.  I have hardly made a print of worth 100/- rupees by the market value: what I got the product paying and throwing thousands !!!!  If you think "" The discount is an offer"" : NO . It is something 'con' marketer like flipkart is awaiting to cheat you.  Value you money and time: Never buy it from the 'con' site like Flipkart.  Flipkart : May I have a response from your end ?"
497,11-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,1,my printer saves the time of mine going out to take a print out but any printer ll do this purpose  i heard 802 catridges for this printer is a failure model because the ink refilling area is too small that it not even giving me 50 pages per refill i refill it locally(Rs.70-80) because of high cost of catridges(Rs.500-1200) still refilling seems not to be of worth coz its jus giving me 35 pages per refill  frustrated :(
498,03-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,"This is a really good product.Best in class in this price range.The printing quality is good for both color and B/W.Scanning quality is really awesome. but if you have XP then installing driver of this printer is little bit problematic.You have to install dotnet framework 3.5 or higher,otherwise it will not let you to install. for windows 7 & 8 it is really easy. HP is claiming low cartridge cost but i have checked it,not so much. You can refill your cartridge in more cheaper way."
499,10-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"This printer is very user friendly....its been one month using it.....Its a great value for money as you scan, copy and printer function with it....Looks are also very good and appealing at this price....I would recommend it for home use....And its cartridge cost is also comparatively low....For users who are complaining about high ink usage, i would like say just go to HP default settings and make print quality from high to normal or low.....  It worked for me....Overall true value for money...Thank you flipkart :D"
500,06-May-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,"First purchase from ANY online retailer, and the result is: SATISFACTORY!! :D Received it a whopping 5 days earlier than what was mentioned at the time of purchase, that too in mint condition and properly sealed.  Printer works fine, as expected from a low range Multi-Function Printer. Scanning also works fine. The only downside is the ink usage but that is to be expected.  I'm really gonna recommend FlipKart to my relatives and friends! :)"
501,05-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,3,Printer is good considering the cost but it takes way too much ink especially in black and out print and while copy even more.
502,25-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,"Hi there.if you are looking a printer for academic purposes where you don't have to print a bulk , this is a really value for money...flipkart service is no doubt very good but the ink which came with it didn't last much..but overall a good product"
503,11-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,Best Printer for Personal Use... Print Quality is great... scanning & Copy is also perfect... Makes a little noise while printing and copying.. but all in all a great buy for Home Use...Looks Stylish also...:) :)   Superb delivery by Flipkart... Ordered on 9th Jan at 01:48 am... got the product delivered on 10th Jan 5:20 pm... :) Kudos Guys.. :D :D
504,28-Dec-2013,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,"Good product from HP for home users Nice to get it delivered by flipkart two days before the scheduled delivery date. print and scan quality are good, easy to setup and maintain. less cost per page nearly Rs 4 if you consider fuel cost while running for print or scan on your bike or car. printer can act as photo copier simply by pressing the button on the printer so good for oldies at home (ink usage will be more in this way). New cartridge one can get approx 90-100 text prints."
505,17-Dec-2013,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,print quality is good its easy to use according to me at this price range its really good printer for home use its good but for office use its not
506,15-Oct-2013,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,The printer works nicely with no problems. The printout is very clear. I am satisfied with this product.
507,25-Sep-2013,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,Today I have Received The printer...print speed is good. scan is ok.everything is all right. hope it will be a good one..must update the details after 5-6 days of use..please wait..
508,21-May-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,3,First things first:  There is no auto enlarge nor any sort of manual button or anything for enlarging/zooming photocopied output !!  Second: Do not expect to scan/photocopy anything even a centimeter bigger than A4 size.  Third: It is slow as it is an inkjet printer so dont buy it if you have high volume usage.  Fourth: No batch photocopying/scanning (means feed several pages into scan/photocopy and then it processes/prints out in one go..until then it stores in its own memory..This feature is not available although it would have been awesome if batch processing and auto enlarge features were actually present..  But if that all is in this printer then how will they sell their more expensive models.  Fifth and Last: Flipkart has disappointed me many times by misleading product information otherwise the product is Okay for the price you pay. Rs.3000 is quite good as the quality of scan/photocopy/print is well maintained.  Although simple printing speed is a bit slower than Hp Deskjet 1000 single function printer.  It is an inkjet so dont expect laser printer speed/quality.
509,02-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,1,I found this printer to be quite INADEQUATE to meet my requirement. My earlier printer HP 4185 All-in-One was so much more versatile. I would like to know if I can exchange this printer with a good Laser Printer of HP brand.
510,04-Apr-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,1,"The cartridge is expensive, and it uses a lot of ink. In less then 60 pages, the cartridge turned dry. And it costs nearly 500 rupees.  Don't buy it. If you are looking for something economical."

515,15-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,1,i bought this HP desk jet 1510 printer. i installed the printer and from the first go the paper got struck inside the printer. 40 attempts and everything futile. i called up flipkart and said that i would like to return it and opt for a better printer. Flipkart executives replied back stating you can't change any electronic product and only the product which i have bought can be replaced. its better to buy electronic products from shops directly or any e-commerce site which gives the option for changing to better one. Regret buying this from flipkart
516,13-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,One of the best products I have bought on Flipkart till date. Very good value for money. Looks elegant. Thank you very much for the prompt delivery as well. Keep up the good work.
517,10-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,1,I ordered hp1510 printer.they gave delivered time on 13-3-2015.Flipkart delivered the item within two days.due to the busy with other work I am unable to collect the item at that time.I asked courier boy to keep the item for two days.but he canceled the order himself and replied the item.  But still I need that item.bad courier partner.so I say to flipkart that don't encourage this type of courier partners which may damage our good will.
518,03-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,3,NOT UP TO THE MARK.... BETTER BUY CANON BRAND.... THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MY MIND IS THAT IT CATERS TO THE NEED OF AN AVERAGE USER..... NOT FOR HEAVY USER...
519,02-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,3,"The printer is multifunction one i.e. it prints, copies and scans. The printing and copying quality is good. Scanning is also perfect. But I had a problem with the built-in ink. It was finished after hardly 50 pages of printing. I did not understand the problem. So the ink had to be replaced immediately after the purchase.  Flipkart delivery was also superb.  I am giving it three star for the ink."
520,27-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,2,"We purchased the printer, less than a month back, not only going with the name of the brand but also with the pocket friendly cost of the cartridge that hp printers provide. As a customer, I am highly dissatisfied, as I now feel my decision of buying this particular product was not that good. Pros: The printing quality, as always, is immensely good, that's what HP promise. Cons: 1. BLACK INK CARTRIDGE GOT FINISHED, EVEN BEFORE THE EXPECTED TIME. 2. DOES NOT PROVIDE THE OPTION OF ZOOMED IN OR ZOOMED OUT XEROX COPY. 3. TRAY SPACE IS NOT SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO HOLD MORE THAN 5 PAPERS AT A TIME DURING PRINTING. Kindly improve these features."
521,25-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"Excellent Quality, scan, xerox(copy), print .   Wow affordable and Reliable.   Go for It, If for home use.  Not recomended For Commercial Office but home people can use this for Small scale Business."
522,23-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,3,"please don't buy this product because it will be too much costly than a local print/xerox shop. print,copy and scan quality is not bad, but the thing is that this printer is not worth of money. go for a laserjet printer.."
523,23-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,3,although its a good deal to buy such a printer in such a low and comfortable price but its cartridge price is so high that u can buy it again in the price of two cartridges. and also drinks cartridge like hell...............
524,18-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,thankyou flipkart for such a wonderful printer. happy to buy this one. there are any places in maharashtra which are not under delivery zone. update areas asap.
525,18-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,good product very excellent working easy to handle any one can operate this flipkart was selling this product in low price
526,17-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,3,"By far this is the most confusing decision,I ever made while shopping online.The reason I say this is because of the dilemma of me spending my money while keeping Present or Future in mind.(Anyhow I bought it.)   Confused? So was I.   Lets be frank,we look forward towards buying this product because this is the cheapest multifunction printer we'll get in the market.Right? But the thing is if we look at it the other way round,we have to spend money more than the value of printer itself in near future,and by near I mean like 2-3 months,because the cost of the cartridge is so damn high and the print quantity,very low.   Coming to the positives,the print quality is above average by the price the product demands,and it looks pretty neat too,it's good for home use but like I said the printing costs are very high.Basically it all depends on your usage.If you are a student looking forward to print your school projects/assignments,this is not the product for you,but if your requirements are limited to printing general documents,this is the real deal.Go For It.   Hope this review helps.   And like always,kudos to Flipkart for delivering the product within the limited time frame."
527,16-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,nice product in a small budget. if u want hv such products http://www.flipkart.com/search?q=PRNDZSMB8FDBWN6J

532,07-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,"good printer can give more than 60 prints on other hand the problem of cartridges can be solved by refilling it from inkjet ink bottles which hardly cost Rs. 75 for 100 ml (prodot ink) and they can be filled for 20 times more.. hence, A GOOD PRINTER available on low price.."

536,31-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,The printer quality is good but the cartridge gets used up soon. If you have lot of printing work then better go for a laser printers. Ok for normal house use and students. Image graphic quality is average in colour printouts. Overall best for house and basic use.
537,30-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,1,"I bought this printer on Oct 17, 2014 delivered within 3 working days due to festivals, even its great that I received before Diwali, as per actual date it would be after Diwali but received much earlier.  About the Printer:  The Color print quality is very good. I didn't took more then 4 prints in color so not much about this.  Scanner is good, printer is also good which has multiple settings for print quality as draft, normal and best.   But for xerox there is no such settings for Draft quality and it copies in normal quality which caused me to take only 50 copies of xerox in 20 days and the black ink cartridge stopped working. I thought it is not working I took it to service center and they told it is empty and they do not recommend refilling it, any how I carried to a shop keeper and refilled it for Rs. 60/- it gave only 2 prints and then not working.  Now I again have to purchase a cartridge for Rs. 550/- which is too high that for 50 papers I need to spend Rs. 550/- means Rs. 11/- per page in black ink.   So, if some is looking for minimum cost should never go for this printer. It is useful as scanner only."
538,28-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,Got a damaged product from flipkart which they intentionally delivered in less than 24 hours.

553,24-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,2,"Hi Team,  I would like to buy HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer if there is Black colour.  Awaiting for you response.  Regards, Kamlesh Suryawanshi"
554,17-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,2,"Hp wants u to pop in money in their account every time, HP gives this product with small cartridge and the no of prints is way below their claim, a time will come when u will have to purchase the large 802 cartridge which costs more than 1000 rs. u can refill both color and black cartridge by yourself instead of purchasing the new cartridge the problem is after a few refills the capacity of the cartridge drops. u ll be able to print hardly 40-50 pages in one refill. u need to fill the cartridge every time u need to print, this is very much annoying. after filling the cartidge u need to give it some time for ink to come to print head. some times the software detects that cartridge is refilled and it wont print anything, u need to reset the printer in this case or turn it off and then on after some time.  the bottom line is whenever u need to print more than 30 pages u ll end up in frustration. all this is a huge mess so its better to go for a printer which comes with large cartridges which atleast gives 200 prints in one refill. now epson comes with ink tank printers. U may check out those  But if ur printing need is very less (less than 100 in a month) and u ll never print more than 10 pages at once then u can go for this. the print quality is very nice."
555,16-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"this printer is unique and the only cheapest printer,it consumes very less ink and is all in one, i would recommend every common man to buy this printer ..."

557,13-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,nice product good for home use to make school projects. delivery was a bit late. Hp printer are easy to install
558,11-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,2,"1) Printers are products where there ink cost is high . So if you are ready to spent money on   inks than buy . 2) For larger number of document prints it is a slow product  3) Ink is expensive , so at the end you need to rely on external printing sources (cyber cafes) 4) Only advantage is scanning documents which is expensive at cyber cafe"
559,08-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,3,"Printing superbly. Since it has scan option also It is above average product for this price. Cartridge is consuming more. i will not suggest for a frequently usage for printing.  Occasional user it is a good product. Cartridge price is low, but I feel it want more cartridge. It is scanning superbly. printing and scanning takes less time. over all i am happy with this product"
560,04-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"The printer is pretty good... U wont get a scanner, printer and copier at this price.... Print quality is also fine.. The only problem is that it it drinks ink like hell... suitable for those home users who have medium use...."

562,01-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"Excellent Product. it's combine with scanner, printer, photo printer as well as lowest cost also. I felt more happy to buy this one. thanks to flip kart fast service also."
563,31-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"While you are buying anything and reviewing always keep in mind the price you have paid for it. If you have paid 2700 Rs for this printer than do not expect something which comes at a cost of 10000 Rs. Therefore my review is based on what I have paid, and what I should I expect in this price.  Good.  1. Body and design is good, you can load paper and collect it very easily. 2. Installation and the software is good, 3. Scan quality is great. And it is really fast 4. Copy perfect, color match is 95%. 5. Print speed is as what it should be. 6. Print quality is perfect, on photo paper it looks, perfectly professional with very vivid color. 7. You can copy color/black without printer  Bad 1. Each Cartridge will give you 50 Pages of plain text or 10 Pages full page photo. So if you are going to use original cartridge. It will be very expensive. But we can refill the cartridge at home easily. 2. If you use refilled cartridge, and continue printing, after some time it will warn that cartridge should be completely empty. If you still continue to print It warns you that you are using refilled cartridge, if you still continue it says warranty will be void. If you continue it will print but reduces the quality. It means the best quality print will look normal and normal quality print will look draft. I think it is something new HP has included to force the customer to buy original cartridge, which will squeeze your pocket.  But it will be in all HP model. 3. There is no way to reset cartridge ink level. Just ignore the message.  4. After new cartridge everything will be OK.   Verdict: If you refill the ink it is great. But remember 802 is not a durable cartridge it will dye within 10 refills at most. If you use original cartridge I recommend buy Canon, printer above 5000 Rs. It will save money in long run."

568,17-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,OK.!! first of all am dissapointed with flipkart. they had some issues with shipping the consignment which took extra 1 week to reach my house. nice packing by the seller and kudos for the seller. coming to the product itself.  the printer is is best for home purpose .  print 10/10 copy 6/10( copying takes more ink which reduces the duty cycle of the cartridge) scan (10/10)  the printer looks awesome but overall build quality can be improvised a little bit. since am using the printer for only about a couple of weeks... i cannot review with the cartridge ... overall best buy..and value for money. nice work from HP and seller ..overall good service by flipkart
569,17-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,1 it is very good for domestic use.  2 Print quality is good but consumes a lot of ink. 3 no wireless connectivity via wi-fi 4 Does not print both sides of the paper automatically

I have to print 10-30 print a week and it is good for that. Heads off to the manufacturer. It would be more comfortable if it has wireless connectivity."
571,13-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,3,i wanted a printer to print at least 1-5 pages per week and this is best for that. i got it very helpful. i will suggest my friends to buy this product too. you should also buy this. its just amazing.

573,04-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,"Best option if you are not continuously taking print outs because the cartridge 802 will give you a maximum of 80-90 pages fairly. The original cartridge costs ~500 INR. But don't worry, refilling inks are available in flipkart itself for ~500 INR for 100ml. Overall a great product from HP and good delivery by flipkart. Took only 1 day for the same."
574,29-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"I live outside India and I wanted to buy a printer for my young siblings, helping them in their school assignments. It is not only easy to print but it was very easy to setup as well ( connect to computer, install cartridges and print! ) I did not had to go through the lengthy process of explaining each bit on call.   The cost of cartridges isnt too high and quality of the print is above average (not too good), however, it does justice to the price you pay.  In the package, along with printer were two cartridges. Would have been more helpful to find few plain white papers as well.  To conclude, I am indeed its very satisfactory and happy customer."

628,24-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,I purchased it as for my son's admission we required now and then print-outs and scanning job. Having printer handy in home is useful as it saves lot of time.

632,19-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"A small package with a lot offerings. Thats what this product is. Bought it for my personal usage and got it within 48 hours. Its easy to setup and install. Easy to use also. Interface is very user friendly with large and minimal buttons, and is a boon for elder people who are not that tech friendly. Cartridges are also cheap unlike Canon. Though printing speed is a little slow in colour but print quality is remarkable . If you need an everyday printer for personal usage, this is the thing you are looking for."
633,18-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,The product is very good for home use does all the basic jobs for home use. Have to mention the delivery and service was very good from Flipkart.

638,09-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,2,"I purchased this product with a high hope. but my expectation was worst . this printer's ink is consuming speedly. only I printed about 20 copies of A4 black. Cons: No switches for scan/copy/print very small cartridges , so need to buy monthly. not woks fully in Linux Photoes are not printing in normal papers ( I was need of it)  Last word: We will attract it for its cheap rate and mufti functions, but it is poor."
639,08-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,If u are an avg user (50-100 copies per month) then this is the best Printer (Print+Xerox+Scan).. Flipkart sells it at a cheaper price.. Thank u Flipkart :)
640,03-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"flipkart always makes me happy by sending cute items. satisfied hahaha, its working great, great color"

642,30-May-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"Another Product form flipkart, a fab one.. i have received it before time in perfect condition and as the days are passing flipkart is making again and again trust . the only online mega store i will prefer."
643,27-May-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,2,very poor printing quality.colors are coming out by simply fingers rolled over. not good for photo printing also.I am also not satisfied with packaging done by flipkart.
644,25-May-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,"Print, scan and copy is very good.  Problem is there are limited buttons in the printer (On/Off, Cancel, Black Copy, Color Copy).  This makes auto enlarge/ fit to page not possible while copying. This is the only disadvantage.  Also, the print area is less. The lower part doesn't print while copying pages which has some contents written at the last of A4 pages. This problem doesn't occur in higher model printers."
645,24-May-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"A beautiful matte finish white, great build quality, prints and scans fast and well, has no connectivity problems. Its everything I wanted at a fantastic price"
646,16-May-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"I needed a printer cum scanner within 4k and then I stumbled upon this in Flipkart. It perfectly fitted my purpose and my budget. However the only thing I was a little itchy about is the color of the printer, it would had been better if it came in black. Installing the printer was real easy and the bundled software is so easy that it can guide any person like my parents who had no prior knowledge of using one like this."
647,12-May-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,"Easy processing, Prompt service and Reliable products. Pleasant experience so far with more than four items."
648,11-May-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,Scan and Print quality is very good. Looks stylish and compact. Would loved it more if the printer came in black colour instead of white. Make sure to print at least one colour page in a week to prevent the ink from drying up if you intent not to use the printer that often. Overall best printer you can get from HP at this price.
649,10-May-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,5,"With this price tag, this is the most cheapest printer in the world with color + copy, scan and print. No hassles while installing on windows 7. Cardtridge insertion also neatly shown in manual which helped to readily use it."

Rest all works very fine and smoothly..
664,12-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,"Printing/scanning/photocopy is very good multifunction without any problem.We use very rear,but still we never faced weak/dry in cartridge problem even after using more than 6 months.Its a value for money with low budget."

679,19-Dec-2013,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,4,"not lightning fast , but does the job, would recommend for home users or for people who do not have too much work load for their printing."
680,01-Nov-2013,HP Deskjet 1510 Multifunction Inkjet Printer,2,"The performance of the printer is not bad, but the ink cartridge does not give not even 25 pages, which costs 679 bucks.So I don't recommend this product."
681,31-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,2,"I bought this from another on line retailer. Its a simple no nonsense printer. Print quality is decent and OK for regular everyday use. The big problem is with scans and copies. As long as your are scanning a thin A4 type of document, it will come out fine. But if you try and scan even a slightly thicker document like your credit card or your passport, the entire border area becomes dark grey. The top flap does not close completely and hence external light causes the dark grey borders. Service center says nothing can be done about it.  So be aware of this limitation before you buy."
682,19-Dec-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,"Its a good printer. Easy to install. Meets my purpose. Came with HP 678 Ink. Also, in order to print only in Black & white, turn the grayscale 'ON' select 'Black Ink Only' in printer properties in the Print Dialog. It took me a while to figure out as to how to print in black & white, everything was getting printed in color."
683,23-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"I have to print 5-10 pages almost daily for my study purpose and what I have found is that:  Pros: >page loading smooth and printing quite fast in draft mode. >very good for b/w texts and the ink bar is over 60% after almost 200 prints >texts appear crisp. >scanning app good >looks very nice  Cons: >color printing is not so good in normal quality, specially if half/full page image(photo) is printed >no copy controls within the software, only two buttons on printer body >scanning bed is very thin, will make problems if you try to scan big books >Color ink depletes very quickly"
684,29-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"firstly the bad things:  * when you switch it on it makes irritating sound. * for those who are saying it can not scan thick items and if we do so it makes blackish stains at the edges , let me tell you it is not true. I scanned 1cm thick photo frame and the scanning was very clear. all you have to do is crop the desired area .  It will make blackish/ grey spots only when the scanning document is larger than A4 size/printer's scanning area...  Now the good ones:  * economically cheap cartridges  * print quality is good for normal use/home use.  * you can scan 4 or 5 photos at same time and you can decide if you want to save it as a whole or each one of them separately (to save as a whole choose DOCUMENTS and to crop it according to your way choose PHOTO).  * to get max print outs always print in draft mood. this printer uses hp678 cartridges which lasts for long than any other of hp cartridges.  * software is provided to maintain the printer. * e printing option is available .  * about printer material-- made from a scratch resistant plastic , looks beautiful (i got white one).  Flipkart service: got my product in 3rd day during the busy festive season. packing was fantastic...for packing i will rate it 6 stars...  at last ...it fits my budget.... ;)"
685,17-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"I purchased this for my son's school assignments. I faced a problem while setting it up initially. I had forgotten to close the cartridge door and accordingly the status LEDs were blinking. Initially we could not understand the problem. Since there was no pamphlet or sticker indicating the meaning of various indicators, I searched in internet and found that this blinking behavior could be because of cartridge door kept open (did not have a CD drive to load its CD and read e-manual). Other than this there has been no issue till now. It is around two months and I still see the ink indicators are healthy."
686,21-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,"Used it for a week, cartridge doesn't exactly give 400 pages in this printer but it's still the best cheapest printer out there. Prints slowly but the quality is extremely good apart from that it comes with a software which makes using this printer very very easy. If you need a printer which gives quality prints, scans and copies then go for this PRINTER DEFINITELY !"
687,11-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,"I bought it from HP store E-mall at Kolkata for 4620. The printer claims to come with full cartridges for B&W and Color but I have hardly printed 15 sheets (MS Word file, A4, containing image tiles for wife's school project) in Plain-Paper-Fast-Draft quality and the cartridge is reporting low-ink. The printer is fast. Really fast B&W prints. The quality of color prints on plain-paper in Fast-Draft mode itself was so good that we did not feel the need to switch to 'Photo Paper' quality. Scanning is average. I have scanned in resolution up-to 2400dpi. The resultant scanned image looks smudged but scannig in higher resolution takes time. Its good for photocopy  OVERALL--BEST PRODUCT FROM HP"
688,29-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,"The printer is very cheap and its cartridges are not very costly. Best for house hold use . It also offers 3 features print,copy and scan. Very fast delivery from Flipkart I ordered it on Saturday and received it on monday morning. It's cartridges are very quite cheap. the tri colour cartridge can print upto 150 to 160 pages and the black and white cartridge can print upto 450 pages.And Its scan and copy feature is also good. Even it prints slowly but the print quality is very good. Comparing to the hp deskjet 1510 series this printer is good because its cartridge is cheap so choice is yours.Thanks flipkart to provide such a product at a great price."
689,17-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"I needed a printer for my home use; mostly for my son' s school project work and my personal document printing. I bought this without much of research since I need it urgently. Got it delivered within a day with Flipkart in a day delivery option. The printer is worth buying. It is easy to operate and print and scan quality is very good.What I like most that it does not make much noise as my previous Epson' s printer. Yes it prints slow, but that's ok for your home use. The only thing which i did not like is the software which is being provided with the printer."
690,26-Nov-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,"awesome print quality, scanning is great as well as photocopy is so easy in this printer .... and less consumption of ink and its better than hp 2515."
691,25-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,1,"Don't buy this product. Flipkart and WS Retail have cheated me. The product page mentions that it can print, scan and copy but it can't copy (no xerox). This is not a all in one printer. Check before buying other printers if it really has Print, Scan and Copy (Xerox) capabilities."
692,22-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,"Previously I have been using a canon printer which I purchased 3 months ago. Without a choice I had to throw it away and buy an HP because there cannot be a bigger non sense available to buy than a Canon printer.  Let me compare this printer with a canon of similar price since it would be a possible dilemma.  PROs: 1. cost per page= approx rs 1.2 [for canon it is rs 6 (don't search for a decimal before 6)] 2.printing possible in single cartridge mode. [not possible with canon] 3.scanning has nothing to do with cartridges [for canon, you have to buy both cartridges even for scan] 4.Print quality- very good [definitely better than a canon] 5.NO noise [canon's noise is like a printing press] 6.scan preview available - very helpful while scanning multiple pages into a pdf. [not in canon] 7.scan resolution can be set as per requirement. [not in canon] 8. cartridge affordability - cost- rs.500. [ canon- rs 900 ]  CONs (comparison with canon) 1. A bit complicated to install. no worries for a regular comp user. 2. scan is slightly slow as compared with canon. 3. scan/copy cover (flip) functions better in canon while working with thick objects like books. A4-no difference.  PS: Flipkart delivered in less than 48 hrs (with shipping distance more than 1800km)"
693,09-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"Hp 1515 is nothing but 1510, but it uses 678 cartridge instead of 802. Have been using it for last 20 days. Printing is excellent and economical too, as I have already printed 300 pages and still have 25% ink left. Haven't got the free cartridge promised but got the money back."
694,11-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,2,"This printer is nice for this price and works as explained. No issues on that.  Shopping experience was awesome. Payment, delivery- all hassle free. That's Flipkart  HP Support - HP promised that it would a Rs.1000 titan voucher. This offer is really good as it further brings down the printer cost and you can gift yourself or loved ones with a watch/sunglasses etc. But these guys now are not willing to stand on what they have committed to offer. Its been months and there is NO response from HP. Pathetic support. This spoiled my mood and made me thinking why i bought this instead of Cannon."
695,15-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,1,Couldn't even print a Word document from it after spending 3 hours with Support. Problem not resolved. I put an end to this waste of time when HP Support wanted me to reinstall Windows.

698,18-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"Working fine. Have not taken many number of print outs but scanning is fine , does not have physical on-off switch , but touch type , according to me this switches worn out faster than physical types.

701,14-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,"Easy print easy scan. Quality of print and scan is awesome. Shape & build also looks good. Low cost cartridge compatibility makes it more affordable so spending little extra bucks on device is not a bad deal. Its Cartridge (HP678) gives four times more prints than the low cost device HP Deskjet 1510 compatible cartridge (HP802). Just add 1100 more bucks in your budget and you are good to go. Now its time to say something about Flipkart service & offer. To be honest, Two free cartridge offer by WS Retail pushed me hard to buy this product for which i am very happy.

705,18-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,Very good quality output of both black and colour catridges. But Colour catridge runs out very quickly. Slow in output but robust in nature.
706,17-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,Pros  Easy printing Low link usage Easy set up  Cheap  Cons  Occupies more space Getting a scan copy is not so easy  Makes too much noise while printing.   But considering the price of this printer and its cartridges this is a worth a buy and it does what it has do best- Good Quality Printing.
707,16-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,"The product is really worth big, specially from Flipkart as it provided quite cheaper price from local market as well as other online shopping sites. My purpose has been fulfilled and I'm very happy to use this multipurpose printer. Te cartridge is available in almost ever store and the cost of per page printing/copying is very cheap. Finally about delivery.....Flipkart is lightening fast in this matter."
708,22-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,"PRICE: 3899 RS. CONS: major problem is installation in windows as it does not come with drivers for inkjet 1515 but it comes with drivers for inkjet 1510 that are not compatible. i am using linux so its not a problem for me.  PROS: 1. comes with ink cartridge 678 that is cost efficient. 2. you don't have to print daily ( ink doesn't dry up easily) i am using it to print every week and its working fine. CHECK OUT HP WEBSITE AND READ ABOUT 678 CARTRIDGE IT WILL WORK EVEN IF NOT USED FOR ALMOST A MONTH WITHOUT PRINTING. 3.it has scan, copy (both color and B/W) functions.  buy this printer if you want a scanner and printer that is not costly and works great for home use."
709,31-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"Great price, good product. Works nicely with Windows 7 but failed to install in vista. Quality is good for a printer in this price range."

711,14-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"Hi Readers.....I ordered the said printer on 11th Dec 2014 and same was delivered to me on 12th Dec 2014. I would like to thank Flipkart for the speedy delivery....The printer was well packed and received in good condition  The installation CD came along with the box. After completing the installation, while trying out I noticed the printer was only able to scan and copy. On giving print command the document was disappearing from the print queue tray very fast and nothing was happening. I tried all sorts of trouble shooting but no success.   Later a friend of mine suggested me to choose a different driver by going into advance setting of the printer. Originally it was showing HP deskjet 1510 series and i changed it to HP PSC 1500 series and to my surprise the printer started working. My friend had faced same problem with his HP 1510 printer. So, after struggling for the whole day the printer was finally able to print copy and scan.   HP should look into this problem....  Its been 2 days now i am satisfied with the printers performance. On the flip side i am not too happy with the size it looks huge......."

For 450 rs a cartridge if you can print about 400 pages and refill it for 50 rupees for a few hundreds of pages more, i see no better option. Excellent printer and very easy to use. Oops, the scanner is very good as well as i forgot to mention. and at times i don't go to the local xerox shop and do it at home. Life is so easy"

723,08-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,1,There are no drivers for HP deskjet 1515 and 1510 does not support. Returning this product as there is no support too.
724,02-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,"Before ordering I had called up Flipkart Customer Service to confirm if this comes with the Colored & Black and white Cartridge or not as in the description it states as Consumables. On HP website it clearly mentions that both Cartridges will be part of the package but the Flipkart Customer Service representative told me only Black & White (HP 678 Black Ink Cartridge) will be part of the package which was actually the freebie with the printer which came along with the HP 678 Tri-color Ink Cartridge & HP 678 Black Ink Cartridge. So I got in total 3 Cartridges. Hope this helps.  Reason to buy this printer as its successful, does the job and the Cartridge cost is less as compared to other models."

734,17-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,A good printer for personal usage with a decent price. The problem is with its scanner. The edges of the scanned documents come black. Otherwise its a good stuff at this price range.

738,05-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,I purchased this printer just in Rs. 3726... but i was shocked to see that MRP printed in the box is more than Rs. 5700....

739,04-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"First I was about to buy laser but it was costlier. Though I had reluctance in buying this, after purchase it proved beneficial in many ways. Scanner, Printer and Xerox - All in one ! This one really helps for Home use and for Home based Business. I recommend you to buy this if your budget is between 3k-5k and for the use prescribed."
740,03-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"At HP, it's available for Rs. 5300. And thanks to the huge discount at Flipkart, I got it in only 4700 bucks. The printer is a little slow, yes, but the print quality is worth it. Scanner and copier works pretty efficiently as well. A catch at this price.  The only limitation .. is that it ain't wireless.Otherwise, definitely worth it for budget printer users."
741,03-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"Its not very fast , takes may be 30seconds to get a printout. Ideal for home use or for small office."
742,02-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,I am completely satisfied with the experiance with the printer as it is really good at every task and prints at quite good speed. Photo Printing is also good once you print on gloss paper
743,24-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,"Really worthy buy! Print quality is so good. Also, a Gift Hamper is coming along so this product was of worth around 3500 for me. Nice deal from flipkart.com !!"
744,12-Mar-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"I like the product, it has features more than my expectation. Only thing is you can not print back-2-back. Print speed is bit slow but this could be normal for Deskjet type. I got offer coupen of 1000 bucks from HP used for cartridge, which is still awaited but got the confirmation that they will send in 4-6 weeks. Good part is its light weight,easy to assemble, just plug-n-play, But I have two laptop, its working with my HP Laptop with window 7, not compatible with Dell laptop with windows XP (Help required :))"
745,25-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer... I find it very cool and handy to use and no words about service awesome as always.
746,21-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,"I'm using it since a month, it was running well & printing quality is also fair. But it creates some noise while scanning.  I have to check yet on the ink consumption...........  2nd Review:-  NICE- using almost a year.  Printed above 250 pages, no refilling done yet. It's seems quite economical. Performance was good."
747,19-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,excellent product.. fast delivery... cheap at price... like it very much and solves my purpose at cheaper rates... it functions also quite smoothly....

749,06-Feb-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"I personally feel satisfied the way this printer is working.The performance is better than my expectation .It s worth the cost,as the printing quality and ease of scanning are very good.To my surprise, the copying is also equally as good as the print quality.this is one of the best for home needs."
750,31-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,"Just bought the printer a month ago as a replacement for my old HP DJ F300.  A great printer. It works great with Windows, but with Ubuntu the scanner driver does not seem to be detected... so in Ubuntu it only prints but does not scan.  Good value for money printer"
751,23-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,4,"This printer has good utility for home use. However for scanning, it cannot do anything longer than A4. Other than this, the printer could have benefited with some wireless connectivity feature. Overall still a good value for money and will server the purpose for most usages."
752,13-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,i am giving 5 stars to this printer as it is easy to install and helps a lot in my school assignments.
753,11-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,Thanks flipkart for the good service and very good packaging...!!!  The printer is very good ideal for home use and the catridges are also very cheap. Print quality is OK but it makes some amount of noise but its not that loud.Overall its a very good printer in this price range.
754,06-Jan-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 1515 All-in-One Printer,5,This is by far the BEST printer i've seen at this price range!! and with Rs.1000 brand redemption offer and 10% HDFC cashback you can just refrain from buying this product.. I'm saving Rs.3 on every B/W printout and Rs.10 on Color printout :-D

757,04-Nov-2012,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,"This is a great printer with high-quality print/scan options. I bought it for my Linux computer but had many issues installing it with Ubuntu 12.04.  HP makes printers for working with MS Windows, mostly, and the printer is configured to be identified as a CD-ROM when connected to USB, which causes issues on Linux when trying to print (Linux is compliant with the USB standard and does not recognize the printer). In order to make it work, the printer need to be configured on Windows not to be identified as a CD-ROM by using the Windows driver CD (UTILS/SIUtls.exe/SIUtils64.exe). Once that is done, the installation on Linux is a breeze. Hope this helps people who are thinking of buying it for Linux computers."
758,04-Jul-2012,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,"Easy to install, quick print, nice scanner. Good for small business and offices. Requires less space. xerox kind function is also good. Must buy if you are looking for low budget high performing printer.  Only drawback is it can't print both side automatically, but at such good price it can be ignored."
759,04-Jul-2012,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,"Value for money.  Never fails on you.  Good printing quality and also very easy to use.  I have been using this printer for more than a year and has never faced any problems with printing, scanning or copying.  The cartridge had to be refilled only after a lot of use."
760,26-Feb-2013,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,"just installed it myself, was easy, nice scan and print was purfectttt fast prints speed , avg scan speed, nice scan image, best print output 1ft*2ft dimensions max, height 1 ft. approx striking looks i got it for 9700 flat 200 for travel so i spent 9900 to be fair to flipkart , it is giving touch rates . i respect flipkart for both rates and delivery  but since they asked of 7 days i was desperate so i bought from a locals verdict:- For a average user who needs a laser quality printouts not more than say  5-10 per day , who has occasional scan jobs not more than say 50 a month, and who has a immediate xerox need in secs , who does not want to go on road  to search for a xerox centre. and who is tight on budget tooo this is the purfecct printer for you baby 4 stars for this printer. 1 star i deducted for 700 pages cartridge"
761,16-Dec-2013,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,3,A very good printer for moderate business or personal use. Even it is the cheapest & very nice printer if you are looking for a Printer+Copier+Scanner+Laser technology+HP. But the finishing of the product is terrible. The front & top faces are fine but the back & inner portions are terribly casted. Also the scanner tray is not so rigid. So I would suggest to spend few more bucks & go for HP M1005.  Toners used: HP M 1136-88A. HP M 1005-12A.  The printing capacity of 1005 is around 25% more than 1136.
762,12-Sep-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,"Good printer, as usual excellent service by flipkart, worth the money. Hope the printer lasts. Cheers"
763,17-Apr-2012,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,This is a very good MFP by hp as I have used other brands like canon and samsung but this is the best printer in its category so go for it. And great job by flipkart to deliver in just 20 hours of placing order.
764,04-Jun-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,"I bought this printer after a lot of research, one thing was pretty sure that i wanted a laserjet and not an inkjet and also that i wanted an all function printer, not only a printer.  I had a choice between the samsung and this hp M1136. Both were in my budget but bought hp cause of the more positive reviews on flipkart by the other buyers who have used either one.  Coming to the printer, its heavy, sturdy and the black colour looks classy. The design is superb, the make quality is excellent, not made of cheap chinese plastic even though its manufactured in china.  I was amazed to note the print speed, whether a print from the computer or a xerox, it took the same time, images printing or a text pdf, the time taken is the same.  Setting up was very easy, i didnt know about the plug n play thing, so i had drivers downloaded from the hp website cause i do not have a dvd drive :)  Scanning is good too, first it scans the document and asks whether its okay or u want to scan it again, so that helps u to make any changes in the quality, size etc  Lets see how many prints can this introductory toner give. But am very satisfied with the functions and the printer and the prints.  Before giving the print command on the computer, u can go to properties and check the box which says 'Print in EconoMode' this will help use less ink, the print will be a lil light but the quality is very good, not faded at all  I would recommend this printer to all who have a budget between 9-10k  Flipkart service was excellent as always, got the delivery next day, within 24 hours of placing the order. Packing was just amazing. Looking at the flipkart carton i thought i ordered a television and not a printer :P"
765,17-Jul-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,"Pros: Nice printer, does its job as advertised. Easy to handle, set up is also easy and hassle free. I was looking for a home printer and dwelling over an ink jet and laser jet. I found this one perfect for me as I dont need to print many color pages. HP print software is always nice. The scanner is good and the copier function is very useful, as you dont need to hook up your laptop or PC every time to make a copy. Cons: The paper input tray always project out and is not foldable or retractable, seems very odd. It can be improved."
766,14-Oct-2013,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,"Everything worked well with this printer until I scanned my first document on it. Very Poor Software offered by HP. Every document scans Twice for the reason unknown to me. Canon E500 that I used earlier had a lot better scanner than this one.  As far as the Printer is concerned, hats off. It works great! Speed is awesome. Copying speed is great.  Sans the scanner, everything is perfect."
767,01-May-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,"I have bought this HP Laser Jet Pro M 1136 before few months for Home use only. Its is very good multi functional product by HP at this rate because i have spend 9500 INR for this.  By cartige which is coming with this product, i am able to printout 750-800 pages. But when i refilled it, still today i have printed more than 1000 page eventhought cartige is not being empty. So its very cheap that for 250 INR (Cartige refilling charge) you can print 1000 pages."
768,16-May-2012,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,"A good all-in-one printer at an affordable price.   However, a drawback is that it doesn't have an Ethernet port if one might want to make it networked, though there's the symbol of network connectivity engraved on its back.  And, Kudos to Flipkart for a speedy and safe delivery!"
769,29-Jan-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,"No complaints about the printer, its amazing..  However, since I wanted it the next day I paid Rs.90 extra, but the printer was delivered 2 days after I placed the order. So, it was no use paying Rs.90 extra, since anyways flipkart delivers in 2-3 days if you opt for normal delivery."
770,12-Dec-2013,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,3,"When I opened the package, firstly I found a broken piece of plastic. I was furious and started looking for the broken side or plastic, later realised that broken part is not mine rather has come from somewhere else in my box. But why that should be there? Box should contain only the items described and not some unnecessary items. Secondly, the printer had numerous scratches and few minor dents which are not acceptable for an item that I have purchased with that much amount."
771,15-May-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,3,although printer scanner functions well.....problem is with catridge ...took only 500 pages..then refill ...then refill then refilll....maintainance and refilling for just 4to 500 pages print sucks.....
772,08-May-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,The print seems incredible within the price bracket. Scanning is pretty good. however the copy feature seems ok a the copy comes with very dark ink and there does not seem to be a method to lighten so that the print comes a bit light in case of copy.  In all a pretty good printer will adequate feature unless you really avoid refilling powdered toner..!! :P as during refilling it spills all over and while refilling you have to wear masks and proper gloves in order to protect yourself from toner spill here and there.  Good Printer.
773,03-May-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,3,Good Print quality. Poor Scanning. Poor Copy. Only a good price point. Will not recommend for Office Use. Good Packing Ok for home use.
774,04-Jan-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,"1. Scanner is of good quality, though the software provided is a very basic one. It does not support fast scanning and needs manual intervention every time. 2. Printer quality is good. 3. Photo copy is also good."
775,15-Dec-2013,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,3,"I have used this printer with Linux, hplip library from HP is available which works well with Ubuntu 12.10 onwards not tried with Fedora and other variants."
776,21-Jun-2013,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,"I have just bought this printer HP LaserJet Pro - M1136 Multifunction Laser Printer and fall in love with it. Great first print speed 8.5 sec. Good scan quality, good copying speed. Very useful for office and home, one can easily do small scale business with it like me. It is multi-function printer, but don't hesitate nothing wrong with it, no trouble at all. Printer performs all its functions very effectively. And at the end i would like to mention about Flipkart.com, which is really doing a great job. I placed my order on 19th June, 2013 in the evening around 6.30 pm and i got my product delivery on next day (20th June) 1.30 pm, which is less than 12 hours... i think it can't get better than this....SO GO AHEAD AND GRAB IT....."
777,26-Mar-2013,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,"Got the printer delivered by Flipkart in 2 days over a weekend.First of all kudos to Flipkart for maintaining exceptional service standards. i am using this printer for the last 2 months but haven't faced any problem yet. Its printing quality is too good. Scanning and copying are of highest quality in this price range. I give 5 stars for ergonomics.Very easy to install. The refill is also very much cost effective. It has got good printing speed.  If you are looking for a multi-function printer, look no further.HP always outperformed others when it comes to serious printing jobs. Happy Printing."
778,13-Mar-2015,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,1,"I got this printer thinking that this would help us print more cheaper, but the cartridge ran out printing some 300 text pages (with in first week) where as they claim it would print 750 pages. The HP support was really sad for new printer which cost Rs10,000/- They were not worried at all they said they cannot do any thing, the cartridge printed 300 pages and now i had to go and buy a new cartridge, This was their solution every time i contacted them and they were not even concern that some one has baught a printer and we should give them a good service and so on. They just lost a Loyal customer . Over all a really sad and worst exp with this Printer service and support provided by HP."
779,03-Sep-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,1,"I am getting printing problem since I bought the printer from local vendor thinking they will support if problem arises.   HP people tried to detect over phone, and decided there is a problem in toner. When I asked for onsite service, 8 days are over, no one turned up.  No Service post sales, think before buying HP."
780,06-Sep-2013,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,"This is indded a very good printer. You can print both sides of the paper without any difficulty. All you need to do after the double side printing is to staple the papers, if required. For the introductory cartridge, dont get surprised if the same gets over after about 400 pages.  Scanning speed and printing speed is wonderful. and no hassles!"
781,31-Mar-2015,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,1,The product is not as great as the specifications mentioned at flipkart.  Go for a better Product and also Try to purchase it directly from HP if possible!!

784,13-Feb-2015,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,Flipkart delivery is fast but  logistic boys are lazy they don't want to climb 3 floors to deliver package
785,13-Feb-2015,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,"I am satisfied with the delivery and packaging of printer, the printer printing quality is better and its fast too, but the toner just got exhausted in printing only 250 pages, please do consider other options in the price range."

790,10-Jan-2015,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,I bought this printer 6 months ago and I will be honest that this is the one of the best printer so far I have seen.   Pros: 1. Best Laser Printer and gives very good print out. 2. Gives good number of print out. 3. Scanner is awsome and can be configured to get good pixel density scan.  Cons: 1. Black and White Printer.  2. No Wifi support.  I will not count this as Cons as it was mentioned in the specification but its pros are that good that you can ignore its cons.  Shushank Shukla

I am using HP Deskjet 2050hc which was purchased about eight months ago from dealer ""Care"" situated on S.G.Road, Ahmedaba, which according to me, though good, but I am not fully satisfied. First of all, the catridge size and the printing speed. Though the usage is not much, the printer does not give the offered assurances at the time of purchasing.  Since I have seen your aforesaid Printer, I was thinking to dispose of the present one which I am using and to purchase the product aforesaid. Does it have the facilities of colour printing, Scanning, copying? Further, I would like to know whether there is any exchange programme so that I can give my present printer and purchase the new one? Of there is such scheme, kindly inform me. Sorry for the inconvenience caused.  Thanking you,  Sincerely yours,  N S Sreeraman."

You have to remove all those shipping tapes and that piece of thermocole which is quite difficult for a new user. Worst Point! They have provided an HP starter cartridge!Not a complete one! The real one 88a costs about 3.5k.So,I am dissatisfied with this! Rest it was a good printer!"

825,11-Jul-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,I recently purchased HP MF 1136 through Flipkart.  I was able to receive this product within a week from the date of my order. The item was well packaged in and out. I was pretty satisfied with that.  To unpack and install the product was quiet easy with few minutes everything was ready to use..  The printing quality is good. Scanning seems to be little slow. But its a good product with very good pricing.   Regarding the price its way cheaper than anywhere else.
826,10-Jul-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,"Its great for home as well as for office, there is a slight problem of user interface for MAC users, you need to download an older version of HP Driver probably for 10.7 for newer versions print may work fine but issues with scanning as a full featured driver for 10.8 and later versions is still not out. Besides this sharing this printer on network through a MAC is another pain. For single users this is a product that brings wonders."

In summary- a best printer at best price from the best online shop..thanks flipkart..u can buy it with closed eyes if u don't need color print.."
851,19-Mar-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,Its a very good printer with high-quality print/scan options. I have been using it for some time. A very useful feature of this printer is that scanned document can be edited in Ms word using the Readiris Pro 12 software installer CD supplied with this printer. The only negative point about HP printers in general is the price of cartridge.
852,17-Mar-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,1,Product is good but after 2 days i can't able to connect using USB cable  its software is very bad when you want to try install its show only Try try to connect the device only but after 6-7 hour later not connected. still i not install own Printer on my system.

855,04-Mar-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,Excellent print quality and speed. A must buy for anyone looking for a multi-function printer. Kudos to Flipkart for superfast delivery yet again.
856,23-Feb-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,"Its basic, Its Simple to use, It serves the purpose for a small office.  I do a lot of purchasing online, not just in India but overseas as well.  As to Flipkart. Keep up the great work guys. Surely living upto international standards, but I would go a step ahead and say that you are a better experience that I have had so far.  Ordering, Online Tracking System, Delivery, Personalization. Its all good. Keep up."
857,20-Feb-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,working perfectly.. great printing quality... little poor printing if u want to save ink.. happy to have it...... :)
858,18-Feb-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,"It's really worth the cost you spend, its so good and user friendly. The printing is clear and fast. scanning has no problem and also copying. the printer itself goes to idle or gets switched off when not in use."
859,16-Feb-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,"Good Good print & photocopy quality & speed very easy to use (my wife who can use it too ie its really easy), one button photocopy Bad Had initial challenge setting it up but once done it worked like charm. Ugly plastic quality is bad, the section where cartridge opens is resting on a joint which seems like handmade, fixing some plastic pieces and a spring which I reckon would snap easily.  Final verdict if price isnt main point, i suggest buying the model next to this one. reason for rating it 4 is the price and overall functioning which is quite seamless  As always 5 stars to flipkart for service and support (i had to get it exchanged as product was faulty first time)"
860,09-Feb-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,Its a very good multi purpose machine and very helpful in scanning/copying.. I am happy with its performance and also its delivery it truly unbelievable. its a very great experience.

862,04-Feb-2014,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,Nice Product at this price. Excellent Print quality.Value for Money. Document scanning takes lil more time compared to other printer scanner.

Installation - plug n play for my win 8, no did not even need the cd. in all great. printing cost is not a worry since in delhi u have good reputed re-fillers like - Refeel www.re-feel.in. They are bit costly than street refillers but give u a quality re feel like original.  Go for it if if suits u - Good product !!!"
876,23-Oct-2013,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,excellent phone with nice colors. One of the affordable mobile for all. But The offer am looking for is not here as expected by me. I got a good offers from the Panasonic.
877,13-Oct-2013,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,"overall quality is just awesome. solid build, this printer is perfect for photo-copy with many functions like enlarge, dark/light, etc. although the software provided for scanning is not that user friendly but no issue with scanning... its crystal clear and the crucial part, printing is just flawless... its a laser printer which can only print black and white, anyway you wont get a colour laser printer at this price range. refilling can be done (u will have to compromise on quality) but its better to refill only 3-4 times maximum, not more than that, and that too from a trusted shop only who will guarantee to use good quality ink and toner....... and after that buy a new cartridge. one thing i noticed that immediately after refilling, quality was very bad, but after some 100 pages, it kept improving, and after almost 500 pages, print quality was almost similar to the original cartridge."
878,03-Oct-2013,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,5,official website and even flipkart says that this printer doesn't support legal sized paper.  but it works fine .. i was scared .. but now i am happy..  the scanning quality of the printer is just amazing .... AMAZING

Would defenitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a MF laserjet printer."
887,10-Mar-2013,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,"This is excellent MF printer I came across. Worth buying it. However it is true just as mentioned in other posts that Flipkart is not offering competitive prices. But overall great product by HP. Only negative point that I can mention is about the scanner quality. Zeroxing is much better but when same document is scanned and printed, the quality is significantly compromised."
888,20-Jan-2013,HP LaserJet - 1136 Multi-function Laser Printer,4,"Got my delivery within 3 days from FLIPKART ..... installing the printer was a piece of cake .... as usual print quality was awesome .. also note that this printer comes with a introductory cartridge which lets u print 700 pages .... yea !!! u heard it !!! 700 pages from an introductory HP Laserjet cartridge ... and the scan quality was pretty good though i wouldn't mind if the print resolution was a bit more than > 600 dpi .... nevertheless this is an awesome laser printer for around 10k ... if you're tight on your budget but seriously want a laser printer at your disposal , get it ..... you won't regret and this is also a great value for money if you ask me :)"

894,17-Jul-2013,HP LaserJet 1020 - 1020 Plus Single Function Laser Printer,4,"Firstly I decided to buy HP pro jet but the Service provider told me hp Laser Jet 1020 is having 12A Toner Capacity which contain almost 500 gram powder when it require to refill. This makes 1500 to 1700 pages to print. but pro jet gives only 1000 to 1100 pages prints and contain 300 gram powder in toner container. I am using HP LaserJet 1020 it is equal and more than CannonLB2900 and gives best results. In cannon LB2900 tray pages are taken more than one page and damages latter page. but in this HP printer at a time only one page is picked up. I used HP Pro jet for 2 years it is very good but HP LaserJet 1020 is more than Pro Jet. Best Luck. Yuvaraj Shamrao Lahute, Court P.A. Kolhapur, Maharashtra."
895,10-Aug-2013,HP LaserJet 1020 - 1020 Plus Single Function Laser Printer,5,"I wanted a printer mainly for the purpose of printing my ebooks as the glare of the Kindle Fire HD screen really hurts my eyes. I came across the product on Flipkart but owing to my father's policy of not buying anything above Rs. 5000 from the net, went over to the local store and bought it.  Now coming to the printer. the name says it, its LASERJET. It has speed of 14ppm and its ink costs only Rs. 400. I had earlier opted for an inkjet but learnt that those printers will eat up a lot of ink and ultimately this printer is the real deal. although it looks a tad bulky, it does satisfy your purpose at the end of the day. IT LOOKS A MONSTER AND PERFORMS A MONSTER!!"
896,29-Oct-2011,HP LaserJet 1020 - 1020 Plus Single Function Laser Printer,5,"I ordered this printer and got it delivered in 1 business day. Hats off to Flipkart.

898,07-May-2014,HP LaserJet 1020 - 1020 Plus Single Function Laser Printer,5,"I have been using a all in one HP print scan copy for my business needs. But sooner I realized that even after refilling, cost per print was above Rs 1 for a page. And refilling an inkjet cartridge also was a hassle job and finally i decided to buy a laser printer. I have been tracking HP 1020 for a pretty long time. Reading the reviews in flipkart made its easy to select the printer and I have been using it for the couple of days. trust me I'm extremely happy to see the print coming from the printer. The cartridge can be refilled and you can bring down the cost per print to 9 paise. Don't think twice. Trust me, Just click BUY"
899,01-Jul-2014,HP LaserJet 1020 - 1020 Plus Single Function Laser Printer,4,"I reqd. the printer next day as my existing printer (same model) had conked off and I urgently needed replacement, and Flipkart delivery was perfect, as usual. Nicely packaged though HP also does a good job at packing. I have been using this model for the last 5 years with almost no complaints/repairs so I repeated this time around. The machine is extremely easy to use, plug n play and very simple to assemble. The prints are crisp and clear. I dont delve much into first copy print and ppm etc as that is irrelevant for my use typically 20-30 copies per day. Overall, great printer and terrific price only at Flipkart (cheapest among all online stores, and even my stationery supplier!)"
900,15-Feb-2014,HP LaserJet 1020 - 1020 Plus Single Function Laser Printer,3,"Long time ago  not many years buy a few years ago It is the time when hp and canon were brothers canon used to give hp technology and they came with this sucessful product and they named it ""hp 1020"" It was very sucessful  but due to some reasons they seprated like hero and honda so Hp decided to pull off this printer  and canon decided to launch this printer with a new name soon Canon was hit in the market and hp was facing a downfall so after 2 years hp decided to launch this printer again in the market and then they launched this printer named it as ""HP 1020 plus""  In many ways Hp is better than other brands  This is a sucessful printer I have seen this printer in all the departments of my college and also in goverment departments and last but not the least the box of the printer says that it supports XP, VISTA , and WINDOWS 7 I dont know that it supports windows 8.1 or not But as far as my experince with windows 8  microsoft has just put a new curtain on windows 7 though I may be wrong ,I just tried it in the college so  CONCLUSION : Its your money  do what you like"

Its clear now that this is the way flipkart tries to make all the lost profits. It is also the way flipkart gets ready for the diwali sale. When the sale starts, they'll reduce the price back to the previous 6300 and advertise it as a great discount, WHILE THEIR 2 MAIN COMPETITORS STILL SELL IT BELOW 6300. Pathetic flipkart."
902,23-Sep-2014,HP LaserJet 1020 - 1020 Plus Single Function Laser Printer,1,Initially around 1 month back it was available for less then 6000 rs. Now increased to 7200. the * for the price rise.

You can also use this product after a month there is mistake or performance reduce or toner problem nothing happen user free. But in case you buy a inkjet it's complicated to user. My suggestion is don't buy a INKJET cost wise only cheaper require lot of maintenance and cartage cost is high for lower number printing pager.

No problem thus far. However, there was an offer of extended warranty. I sent the draft to the address of HP through DTDC but it came back as the address could not be located. I wrote to HP and called them several times, nothing worked. Gives a very bad experience of customer service. In between, good work by flipkart - delivering it neatly packed and well within time."

939,17-Jul-2014,HP LaserJet 1020 - 1020 Plus Single Function Laser Printer,5,An absolutely brilliant purchase from every angle. The printer is amazing (perfect for a small office / home).

941,04-Jul-2014,HP LaserJet 1020 - 1020 Plus Single Function Laser Printer,5,Probably the best Printer in this range. I have a HP deskjet F4288 an Inkjet Scanner + Printer. But it was highly ink consuming. Also the ink used to dry in few weeks. This was my reason to buy this product. A black ink toner is provided with this Printer which is easy to install. Just follow the manual. Special thanks to Flipkart for such a great product!

947,21-Jun-2014,HP LaserJet 1020 - 1020 Plus Single Function Laser Printer,1,"Though the prices are on a bit higher side than other shopping sites, we just come here hoping to get better service. But now the service aspects of Flipkart have become really pathetic. They cancel orders without any proper reasons and ask us to wait for weeks to get refunds. Even the customer care executives are so useless and don't speak anything relevant to the issue.They have become lethargic on every level.  This has not been the first instance and I am really disappointed with Flipkart now ! There is no point in bearing with all this non-sense when there are some other good alternatives.  Look around before u order here and do the smart thing !"

A good buy it seems as prints are good quality,. Have to check out life and efficiency of toner. Let me SEE and report back. Till now, good ROI."
971,31-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,2,"I have been using this printer for quite some time now. While brand HP is highly trustworthy, I believe it is important for users to be also aware of some technical insight of this printer and hope that my review shall help users make a more informed decision.  Needless to say HP has this line of Deskjet printers (2545, 1510 etc) for personal/home use and they are simply great when it comes to Value For Money.  Some of the good features of this (HP 2545) printer are  1. Easy to install, It actually is, if you do a bit of homework and just seamlessly follow the setup instructions 2. Economical cost of cartridges. Good ratio of pages/cartridge  3. Clarity of scan and photocopy. Various DPI /Resolution options possible for scanning. 4. It is a Network Printer so can be installed on multiple devices hooked to your WiFi network. Can also be seamlessly connected from PC/Laptop that has a wired connection to your router. 5. Print quality shall not be as great as Laser but certainly very decent for home usage.   Still what makes me rate this at average???  This printer and for that matter the related series of HP DeskJet printers (both USB as well as WiFi capable) that DO NOT offer Borderless Printing have one particular feature, they need about 1.5 Centimeter of margin at the bottom that remains as Non Printable area of the paper.   So while this printer does support A4 size page, it is just not going to print anything within that bottom margin of 1.5cm. This is behavior by design. For applications running on PC, this is no big issue, as you can always adjust the margins in Page Setup and/or scale the output to Fit the Page wherever necessary while firing the print. Sadly if you have an A4 sized certificate where important information (Say signature of certifying authority) or may be an elegant border running within 1.5cm of the bottom edge, the Photocopier function shall simply miss it. You shall have to scan it first and then print it using Fit To Page option (from within PC apps) as the copier is not having any intelligent logic therein. You shall even notice that the scanner light returns from Letter mark and does not go up to A4 mark when you hit the Copy Button.   So practically this device shall photocopy only up to Letter size, in order to accommodate its Print Margins. This info is disguised within specifications, in a way it is there but not in plain layman language, rather more in tech language of Paper Handling and Margins.  I would have expected HP to have implemented some auto scaling logic while photocopying A4 in this device. PhotoCopy is more or less automatic operation without any PC interface or any application controlled printing as offered by Acrobat reader or Office apps. It is a bit annoying to see that the photocopy is simply going to miss the 1.5 cm of A4 bottom!!   It is possible that many users may not be aware of this and even those who own this line of printers may not even have noticed it, unless you ever need to hit a full A4 photocopy.  As already said, my purpose is just to enable users to make a more informed decision. These intricacies shall not be told to you by anyone before you make a purchase."
972,22-Dec-2013,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Update: All of a sudden printer stopped accepting photo paper although normal executive papers were working fine. So basically it showed paper feeding issue. I logged a call with HP support and did troubleshooting steps sent to me on email, but nothing worked. Finally an onsite engineer came (yes, this printer comes with onsite warranty which I didn't know) and fixed the printer in less than 30 minutes. The problem was due to foreign object - ear bud was blocking the path of roller! don't how ear bud landed in it, but now its fixed. I recommend to go for this printer as it is value for money + nice customer service from HP!  Old Review: I purchased this from a retail store here in Mumbai @ INR 5000/- (I could have got lowest quote of 4900/- but stock availability was on Monday).   1. Print Quality is very good and is very fast for text 2. Head comes with cartridge, so no worries of head getting damaged in case of refill. If so, get a new one. 3. Wireless Printing setup is very easy. (You must connect via USB cable once before setup). 4. New cartridges are cheap 425/- each approx. 5. Very light in weight. 6. Printer is noisy but acceptable. 7. Wifi Direct capability, you can print from mobile / tablet even if you don't have router. 8. Scanning quality is very good. 9. Copy feature consumes ink, so better scan and then print in draft mode to save ink. 10. Not sure how many print will cartridge will yield, but box says ~300 or so.   I did lot of comparison with other similar products and research, I suggest to go for it as it is value for money and cost effective for recurring use.  I am marking 4 star, will update after more use of this AIO."
973,10-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"i purchased this printer a month back and i am very happy with it, i got it for 4600 after the 10% discount and i also got a free cartridge ( but since there was a problem and the cudnt deliver the free cartridge they gave me a refund of rs 450 ) so basically i got the printer for 4150... i have printed around 90 photos till now and i am on the 3rd colour cartridge and and still on the 1st black cartridge the usage is as follows   1st Colour Cartridge 4*6 = 22 Photos 5*7 = 22 Photos  2nd Colour Cartridge 4*6 = 4 Photos 5*7 = 33 Photos  1st Black Cartridge  A4 = 60 Pages still over 3/4 of the ink is remaining  Pros 1 It can print decent quality photos in max dpi for home use ... (get the correct Photo Paper)  2 Black and white printing is fast and in draft mode even faster... 3 Scan quality is good...  4 Wireless printing is awesome, i have printed everything wireless never connected the usb...   Cons 1 No borderless printing at that price... 2 Using refilled cartridge avoids warranty?  also i see some people saying that while printing photos the ink doesn't stick it depends on the photo paper, even i had the same experience with the first 2 pics i printed and i knew then and there that it was the photo paper went on and got kodak photo paper and the pics came out good i have bought around 4 different brand of papers and didn't have a problem with any yet other than the initial paper that i had bought....  u can refill the cartridges and use it but it says it will void the warranty and also it doesn't show teh ink level   hope this was helpful"

975,12-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I needed a Printer for Home use and after doing some research on the available Inkjet printers in the market , i closed down to HP 2545 Deskjet . The reasons were : 1) Lower Printing cost . This is the basic fact that cheaper printers have High printing costs and Costlier printers have Lower printing cost . The Black ink cartridge for 2545 model comes at around 480 Rs MRP and lasts upto 400+ pages . So, per page cost is around 1 Re. only . Saves a lot of money in long term . 2) Wifi Direct connectivity : This printer can be connected through a Local Wifi Lan and function as a Network Printer for multiple users OR it can be directly connected to a computer via its own wifi network ( no cable needed ) . So, print from anywhere in your home :) 3) Pearl White body : Looks very upmarket 4) Scans over wifi over http interface :) . Just connect to printer`s wifi and type the ip : http://192.168.223.1/ . Scanned copy is displayed on your web browser interface . 5) Photo paper printing is also Good in Quality . Now, i can develop my passport sized pics at Home :)  And the best part is, with HP redemption offer, i got a set of Cartridges free ( 1 Black + 1 Tricolor ). P.S. : I bought it at 4139 /- . I dont know How come the prices have increased so much now ? Probably due to rising demand :)"
976,19-Apr-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"The multifunction printer is one of the best available in the market for the price range. The transaction was smooth and the printer was delivered on time and in good packaging.   I expected the configuration of wireless printing option to be smooth but that was not the case. I kept running into various problems (my laptop is brand new and had the latest firmware) and could not wireless connect my laptop to the printer. I eventually did it the old fashioned way by connection through USB cable. The instructions to plug-in the cartridges were pretty lame. It requires little bit of skill to get them into the printer. Its a faulty design but works in the end.  Tested a few print outs via wireless connection and quality looks good. I have not yet tried printing from a mobile device. Overall, pleased with the product. I am going with 4 stars because of issues during installation.  I submitted the barcode and invoice picture on the HP website (for the Rs.1000 offer). Got an acknowledgement on the submission but no other communications from HP."

Received the product from WS RETAIL (the vendor).....and Flipkart (of course) well before time. Must mention here that Flipkart takes great pains to ensure the quality of packaging. (The printer carton was well protected within the Flipkart carton with air packets on all 6 sides).  Set up the printer both using the USB as well as wirelessly. Setting it up is a breeze with the attached CD. (Had initial problems setting it up wirelessly.....contacted HP customer support....yes you do get customer support....and got it resolved immediately).  Now coming to the functionality of the printer itself, Quality of prints and scans is very decent. Even the copies taken through the COPY Function do not lack details to a great extent. Have been using it for the last 5 days and my initial impressions 'bout this product is that its a really good and affordable ALL-IN-ONE PRINTER for light home use. (PS: Initially was planning to buy Canon Pixma All-in -One Printer, since it supports CISS. However cost of ink cartridges for HP2545 is very less....so no problem.)"

985,02-May-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I just love this printer. My previous HP printer (almost 2 year old) had an issue with the printer head and the replacement of the head was costing me Rs. 4700. I choose to buy a new one instead at Rs. 4300. I was little skeptic about this model initially but was not keen on spending a lot. When I started using it...it is just awesome. The print quality is just great and also the cartridges cost me 1/3rd of my previous printer. Overall a great buy and love the features. Even thought the specs doesn't talk much about it photo printing capability, I printed a couple of photos and they were really good. The only flaw I noticed was that the black color on the photo did not settle/stick completely and got cleared by a tissue paper...other colors were strong. Not sure if I need to wait for a min to two after printing. To sum it up...it is a great value buy...very cost effective without any drop in the print quality. Love it. Strongly recommend it."

991,24-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,the color prints taken from this printer as so flimsy and pathetic... you can easily smudge the color of the photograph unintentionally even after you keep in the sun for 2 hrs. can you imagine that!!!!   Flipkart.. please provide negative rating option. this one deserves -5.

993,19-Mar-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"Printer Cost is Less. Ink cost is high. Maintenance also high. In this way hp people Say ink advantage printers. Cost per page printing is 90paisa. But other printesr like espon inkjet printer(L355 or L series). print cost is very less around 20paisa.(though printer cost is high) Finally Hp people squeeze money indirectly from you.  After few days you suffer from Errors like stalled,fake paper jams. Don't buy my dear people. Some people say scanner also keep trouble. I'm posting this review with my experiance. Worst Hp Printer........ Go for espon for bulk printing. Don't use hp inkjet printer. Believe me. Actually i need not to post this. But only to educate you people i'm posting this."

If this printer is connected to ur laptop or computer you cannot use Internet.... They gave me a Installation setup CD still its not working... I couldnt able to print it from my laptop since i bought it .....Think twice before u buy.....
999,20-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Wireless printing is a great feature on this model by which you can make use of mobile devices for print and scan. Only thing needed is both the devices needs to be connected to same wifi network.  Upon accessing the installed app (hp all in one) on mobile device,the icons (scan,print) and all will become active if connected.For printing go the file,select the printer and shoot.For scan place the document on scan bed and click on app.It allows you to save it as pdf or image.  Cons: Keeping the printer ideal with powered on for long time makes it misbehave. The solution is a restart in such case."
1000,19-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,I bought this printer recently. After receiving this I called the HP customer care for installation. already 4 days over but nobody come and helped us on installation. I called two times to hp customer care. but no proper response from them.  Flipkart team - don't mention u r product specs that HP will provide the free installation support etc things.They are junk and will damage u r fame also.  Still I am waiting for their installation.
1001,14-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I've purchased this printer from local store at Rs-5,500/- a bit pricey ,but except the price the Printer is very good ,good looking ,easy to use ,print from anywhere within range by the help of wireless technology. All function speed is overall good ,Just connect with power cord and print from laptop or phone or pc , connecting is easy , ink cartridges are also in budget , So, this is one of the best wireless ink advantage printer available on market by hp. Recommended by me , thanks to hp for a quality product."

1004,08-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Services provided by Flipkart is very good and the product is also good. Flipkart's corier service is fat enough which is unbelieveably good. HP deskjet printer is a nice product I bout from flipkart. Solved all of my purpose of printing, photo copy and scanning."
1005,07-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I have used this product for the past 4 months. I must say it is the best printer in this price range. HP offers great online support and has updated the drivers online. What i mean to say is HP doesn't forget it's customers no matter how long you have been their customer.
1006,05-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"This printer is pretty amazing. It is fast, economic in terms of ink cost and spoilage, and the wireless feature is a stunner. Must buy printer for day-to-day home or soho purpose. Wish it was available in other colours, hard to maintain in white (reminds me of good old late 90s/early 2000s)."
1007,03-Feb-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I got this this printer last week. The delivery was prompt by flipkart as promised. Overall I am happy with this product that's too with this price. The printing quality of both colour and b/w is nice. Easy to install (Even as wireless). Only copy speed could have increased little bit but most of the Inkjet's are same kind of speed.
1008,30-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"HP is a King in Printer Brand,As per performance grate value for money. Printing cost Rs. 75 per page. warless printing is awesome. I print direct from my mobile and Tablet."

1012,04-Jan-2015,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,2,"For the 1st time, I am confused about what to say in a review. Part of my brain wants to praise the printer but most of it wants to vent on HP. I had an Epson printer which finally died after 5 years in service. I bought an HP printer thinking that it will be like 'Maruti' car ! Easy to setup and servicable by anybody's uncle. IMPORTANT NOTE: I have a Linux/Lubuntu laptop.  It works ok when I connect using the Wireless function. Sometimes it refuses to print even on wireless. Also, for some weird reason, it prints a test page on the 1st sheet of paper I insert into the tray. Its legibility has already decreased even though I have used it to print only about 10 pages in a month.  Why did I give it 2 stars? Of the 10 pages I have printed so far, 8 have been of good quality ! So, it does work most times till the law of averages catches up, that is. If you live in the Windows world, this might work flawlessly but you will never know until you buy it."
1013,31-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,PRODUCT WAS WELL PACKED AND DELIVERED TO ME WELL IN TIME. PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCT IS GOOD . THANKS TO FLIPKART .
1014,22-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Liked it!, Printer quality is good, :-). Installation is very quick and easy and Flipkart service is really good and fast."
1015,18-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Overall I like this printer. There is no issue. It gets connected through my ipad/iphone/ipod, laptop, etc. Just a little lag in connecting. And it prints a symmetry page in color every time it starts. Print is good quality and speed is also good. Light weight, wifi is good. Overall a nice buy."
1016,01-Dec-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,It is an awesome printer for the price and does its job as specified. I ordered this printer and got it for Rs.4999 with a free ink cartridge and free installation but I didnt apply for the free installation as I know how to install a printer as it is a matter of a few minutes.  Coming to the printer it is very good and works well with my desktop and the eprint app.  It looks good but the plastic feels cheap and therefore we cant complain as for this price we are getting performance and not quality.  The copy function is also very good and the scanning quality is also very good.  I wish they had provided with free A4 sheets also with this printer then it would have made a very good deal.  Hats off to flipkart for its delivery and HP for its awesome printer.
1017,30-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,I bought this printer on 22nd november.I unboxed it and found that it wont turn on.I called HP support and the technician told me that there was a problem with a hardware.I called flipkart on 23rd and asked for replacement.My complaint was registered and the date given to me for resolution was 27th.My complaint went in vain and flipkart didnt seem to be bothered with my case.I called them on 27th again and another resolution date was given that was 30th.I didnt get any calls till today(30th) and i got a message that my complain will be resolved till 2nd dec.Flipkart has such a terrible customer service.They dont seem to be concerned after the product is delivered.Im a regular customer of flipkart and this was really not expected.I hope my case will be solved soon.
1018,26-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"A good printer for the price. Wireless printing and scanning makes life really easy as you can eliminate the messy wires. One glaring disadvantage is the speed of the printer. It is quite slow. This is ok in home environment but, if you are thinking of buying it for an office it is a big NO.  Praveen"
1019,16-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Hi Everyone,  I'd recommend this printer to all the folks who are looking for easy hassle free printer with the advantage of low cost ink to go for this one. And yeah of course Wireless printing...its just a bliss this device and thanks Flipkart for delivering before time as always."
1020,10-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,this was amazing for homely use this is not at all useful for bulk or large scale usage only for personal and home usage
1021,06-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Sufficient features for a good home printer. Worth the money you pay for it on Flipkart. Comes with one color and and one black ink. Easy to use. Works smooth wireless for me.
1022,01-Nov-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Bought this for an unbelievable price during the Billion Day Sale. The shipment was delayed a bit, but then that was the only negative point so far. Printer is working really well and the print quality is really good Setup was a breeze. Bought this to replace Canon Pixma series which is a piece of crap, catridge got over afer prinitng 50pages and the caridge costs IR2600 combined (Canon... awesome way to loot people).  Go for this model if it is for home use and you do have prints regularly , black catridge will print well over 300 pages. Awesome buy."
1023,29-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,I purchased this printer from local shop.Can any one explain of printing wirelessly from android mobile or desktop. if we can print from desktop after installing wifi pci card or wifi adopter?
1024,26-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,Purchased it as gift for my nephew after comparing it with many others printers and he is happy for the choice we made. Simply the best printer available for the given price.
1025,25-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I am using this printer for home purposes. Weekly 5/10 prints.   Pros #1. Size and shape of the unit is neat, wont take much space and portable. #2. I like that i can copy documents without even starting my PC, it works just like a copy machine. power on -> keep your doc under scanner -> press go..done. #3. Printing speed in draft mode is good #4. Start up time is less than 30sec #5. Good price printer #6. Black cartridge is not very costly as well. (I mean works for me)  Cons #1. Printing noise if little higher at times. #2. Printing speed (good quality graphics) is low. #3. I have seen that some times, when i print graphics for my kids project on A4 bond it takes quiet some time to dry the ink. May be it is pushing lot of in on the paper. I am not sure if it is a fault in my unit or all unites are just like that. #4. No ""Print"" option when you scan documents. You have to save them and then print. I cant use copy function because i want to crop the unwanted from image area after scan."
1026,25-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I was in need of buying a printer from a year Asked everybody they say go for Laser Printer.  Was hesitating as i wanted a MFP and laser in 6-7k range provided only single function printer. After tackling everybody bought it . And i was wow. Packing was awesome and it was easy to open. The setup was damn easy just put in the CD and you are done. The print quality was very good and Wireless printing was the best feature . Do not this printer only supports Wireless printing Not HP eprint Which means that it can print wirelessly when connected to same network. The scan was damn clear and photocopy is just breeze . I only installed the black cartridge as i don't need the tri color for now. A complete satisfactory product . My suggestion go for it.....
1027,24-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,It a value for money product. Flipkart had given an extra black ink catridge free with the printer. Performance wise good too. Suggested for home use.
1028,19-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I ordered this printer late on Wednesday 24th Sep 14 and it was delivered Friday morning. Hats off to Flipkart for lightening fast delivery. Talking about the printer. I browsed for this printer at other sites and found the cheapest price at Flipkart. It has all the functions that I needed. I had checked for other similar models from other companies, but this printer fits all the requirements. Wired as well as wireless setup was easy and the setup wizard had all the instructions. One of the major advantages is the ink cartridges used by the printer. I have printed over 70 pages with the trial cartridges that came with the printer and there has been no change in the ink levels. Wireless works like a charm. We had to download the HP app from Android Playstore which allows printing from a mobile or tab without any problems.  This printer does not have a physical button for scan and that is the only minus that I can think of. So scanning requires you to power on your computer. Great printer priced perfectly and a major advantage is the INK ADVANTAGE cartridges.  GO for IT"
1029,12-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"Printer was good while it worked (for 1.5 years). After that it suddenly stopped working and that is how I experienced how dysfunctional the HP experience was: * The combination of lights that showed up on the printer is undocumented on HP support (orange attention and both green expand and shrink copy lights). * HP support in Pune is abyssmal. On calling the all-India call center, I am repeatedly given someone's mobile phone for Pune support. That mobile phone is continuously busy most of the time. The one time a lady did pick up she said she wasn't working that day and asked me to call back later?? * HP online forums couldn't help either and redirected me to HP support in my country. * When I finally did get through the person, the rate was Rs 1250 for the site visit. For a printer that was purchased for Rs 4000. Even bringing it in was Rs 750 just to inspect what is wrong. This doesn't include cost of fixing the product in case some component has failed.  With such a horrible support experience, I'm dissuaded from trying any of their products again. This isn't the same company whose legendary support earned them accolades and a loyal following in the 80s and 90s."
1030,06-Oct-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,Flipkart is cheating customers in the name of promotional offers.. Please don't fall for the fraud.  I have earlier bought items from flipkart and as the days went by flipkart is becoming a rouge company that has started cheating the customers.  They did not deliver the pen that was supposed to come with dell venue 8 pro tablet previously and now they are not giving the option to even cancel your order even though it has not been processed yet.  This is violation of consumer protection laws and these idiots need to be sued.  I am furious with your attitude flipkart..
1031,30-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,its quite best printer at this range..its amazingly works in wireless network.The multifunction printer is one of the best available in the market for the price range. The transaction was smooth and the printer was delivered on time and in good packaging.   overall my suggestion is worth buying
1032,28-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I had bought this printer after lots of comparisons, permutations and combinations. Finally ended up buying HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer. I have been using this for over 6 months and I am very much satisfied.  Pros: 1. Wireless printing - I do not have to plug my laptop to print. Same printer is shared across multiple systems. 2. Ink Cartridge - As quality of HP inks are commendable, here you get the same quality at a low cost as compared to other HP cartridge models. 3. Scanner works charm. 4. Installation - Installation took hardly 15 mins to get printer working. 5. flipkart service - Great service by flipkart. On-time delivery with very good packaging."
1033,25-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"Very poor delivery service. A SMS message is received from the company early in the morning that item will be delivered today before 7.00 P.M., you has to wait all the day for the delivery of your good and in the evening at around 7.00 P.M. the company has on its own rescheduled the delivery for next day. Further as per my past experience courier boy are before visting home are not making any calls to confirm whether customer are at home or not. Thus by purchasing item you may also get tension of delivery of your goods free of cost."
1034,21-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Good printer. Easy to setup. Best for home use. Easy to setup wireless printing. Outside packaging crushed a bit, but no impact on the printer packing or to printer. Delivered in 2 days. Thanks Flipkart."
1035,19-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Overall evrything is fine as per printing. It's lightweight and network connections are easy and wireless printing is effortless.  Problems I face with this printer :- - plastic body, I feel it may break if not properly taken care. - there are no functions or modifications we can do to a simple xerox copy for ex. re-size  Or any ohter modification it just comes as it is."
1036,17-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,1,"Delivery was prompt but the printer delivered was damaged with scanner not working. replacement was requested and the printer was replaced. This time printer was unable to take colour prints, though scanner was working. Again the replacement was requested but it seems flipkart do not replaces twice....still waiting for a call from flipkart....struct with a printer which cannot take colour printouts..... i have ordered numerous times from flikart ranging from mobiles to books and this is the first time i have encountered this problem.....it seems with expanding business flipkart is going down on service......  PS: I havet been able to get the wifi working till now.......   Single star for delivering defective product twice.......and still struck with that product...."
1037,15-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I ordered this product on saturday and received within 24hrs on sunday. Thanks Flipkart for their excellent service. This is one of the best products i have purchased till date. Set up very easy and the wireless feature is the greatest amongst all of them. I tried photocopy - excellent copies, i tried scanning of important documents - excellent, i tried printing - color and b/w both are excellent.  Total value for money, i strongly recommend this product who are trying to find the best solution for their home usage. Please go for it without any doubt."
1038,13-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"It's always better to review a product,which I have used. very good and worth of money. cheaper then other store."
1039,13-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Best printer at this range. I got this at price of 4599 with HP 678 extra catridge free.Experienced a great deal.and got it next day of order.
1040,12-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"The delivery was on time, thanks Flipkart.  The printer build quality is good. It was easy to connect the printer to the wifi. Just follow the guidelines written on the booklet and the configuration guide while installation of printer through the CD provided. It can be connected through any device which connected to same wifi network. it also give option to connect wireless when there is no wifi at your home. The printing speed is slow compared to another printer, but it will not bother much as you can just sit at any place of your home and give print outs."
1041,11-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I dont have any windows machine in my network. The supplied CD is for Windows / Mac only.  This printer does not have a way to search available Wifi network and connect from the printer hardware (no display / touch / keys) . I bought this printer believing that there will be some thing on the printer hardware that would let me connect to the network. But no.  Only option is WPS. Used WPS to make the first connection to the network. Then the printer was accessible via the browser via using ip address assigned to it on the router. Set it to static IP. Installed the printer on linux machine using HPLIP 3.14.6. Some of the lower versions of HPLIP does not work for this printer. Even this version was unable to find this printer via USB connection. Then works like a charm. I have in the past used HP inkjets on Windows - always was a head ache. Print does not go through from windows, windows hung, Printer needed on / off and on. This was several years back though.   If you do not have WPS supported router, better go for some higher models that support connection from printer in a non Windows / mac network.   Printing and scanning quality / speed are above average. cartridge is reasonably priced. Rating it 4 for lesser support for Linux."
1042,08-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Easily connected wireless, no problem.  when i try to connect it with tata photon max wifi, it was unable to connect, but then i connect it by using my old D-link router and it connects easily..after that no problem faced."
1043,06-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I ordered this which got delivered in 3 days.. Kudos to Flipkart packing and fast delivery. It was mentioned that 10% discount plus hp ink cartridge. But what I received was printer with just sample cartridges which u anyways get with an new hp printer. The way it was mentioned on the website, it felt that there is an extra cartridge also bundled with the printer. So was not happy with the issue. Reported to Flipkart and got it resolved in a timely manner. Very happy with the after sales service.  About the printer. It is a very good product and at 4200/- It was a great deal. :)"
1044,06-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,I have been using this for last 1 month. Very good for basic home usages. Connected on my home wifi easily. You just need to connect your printer once with you laptop for configuring wifi. Print quality is very good. Strongly recommended for home purpose.
1045,04-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Bought this printer for my home use. Flipkart sent it well in time and safe. The installation was a piece of cake. You just need to insert the disk in your computer and follow the instructions. In 15-20 mins, I had the 1st print in my hand. Operating this printer is very easy. Print and Scan quality is good. Does not take much space and the best part is wireless printing."
1046,04-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Received the Printer with Good Delivery from Flipkart. Packaging was good enough. Works like a charm. Only issue I faced is when the IP address of the Printer gets changed to another and the lappie shows as if its offline. After browsing the web for troubleshooting, I figured how to assing a static IP to it and after that there has been no problem. Prints and scans whatever you throw at it. It can work via your Wifi routers network or directly on wireless without your network router that is if you dont have one.  You can print directly from your Windows, Android or IOS Device. Great buy."
1047,04-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Thank you flipkart for such an amazing product. It is actually value for money Easy to install & use.

Got delivery at 11 am next morning. 12 Hours turnaround time and that too overnight!!  Product is good for home use - strictly for home use. Easy setup. B/W printout is good. Color photo printout is ok. Ink doesn't dry quickly. But as I said - strictly for home use.
1049,02-Sep-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Highly satisfied with this printer...I was planning to buy the 1515 model but ended up buying this one for a bit extra for the Wireless feature. Probably the best printer within 5000. I will highly recomend this.
1050,30-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,This is my first home printer..... It gave me awesome printing experience..... I read in many reviews installing for first time is hassel job!!! But it is less than 10 min!! VERY MUCH SATISFIED WITH THE EVERY FEATURE OF THIS PRODUCT!!  Lastly its time to WSRETAILS...... You done a great job by shipping it in 48hrs although you mentioned it will be 96 hrs...... 5/5 for shipping  3.5/5 for packing....Good if you do it better
1051,28-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"My Basic Requirement i) Able to print from Tab or computer wirelessly ii)Printer can be placed anywhere as I had space constraint near computer iii) Cost effective in terms of No. of pages per catridge iv) Able to Scan directly to tab so that I can refer and print when there is an absolute need  Zeroed in on Ricoh SP100SU and HP 2545. Former does have excellent review but its not wireless capable and also cartridge replacement cost is also quite high.  Finally purchased HP 2545.  Received Brand new HP 2545 the very next day (normal delivery)  Since I am technically sound, setting up printer was a breeze. Functions (print/scan/copy) is just fabulous. Love that wireless feature wherein I can scan directly to tab/mobile.  Hats off to WS Retail, Flipkart and HP team for an wonderful experience with their customer support, product & services.  The last thing would be, hope HP won't raise the prices of their cartridge instead with some innovation will cut down the price of cartridge with more prints per page.  Students particularly will be the highest beneficiaries as they need to scan and print very frequently to prepare for their school/college/competitive exams."
1052,26-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Best printer at this range. Just sync with your Network through the software provided by the HP then enjoy wireless Scanning and Printing.  The Print Quality is good . Flipkart Fast Shipment. Good one at this range. Printer and HP 678 Tri-color Ink Cartridge cost Rs.4762. Which is a good deal from Flipkart
1053,25-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Its a decent printer for the price, packs a lot of features for the price and uses Ink Advantage Cartridges thus saves money. The only downside due to the lack of a proper display is that setting up the printer with WiFi. Initial setup was done through the CD and USB supplied easily though it took al while. Printer looks decent although I'm sceptical about the white colour and it collecting dust."
1054,15-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I was looking for a cheap printer where I could print wirelessly. The HP Deskjet 2545 is perfect for my purpose. Connect it to the network, install the software and you are all set to print and scan wirelessly. The cartridges cost pretty low as well. Download the HP all in one and remote printing mobile apps and you can print from your mobile phone/tablet as well and also access all the printer features like scanning. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a printer at home,"
1055,12-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"This printer is tough to set up at first time, but is easy to use thereafter.  Buy with complete peace of mind. I got mine from flipkart in a day!"
1056,05-Aug-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"It was very useful, easy to use, wireless printer. Good for Home Purpose. Useful during emergency requirement for printing tickets, reports etc., Flipkart as usual delivered it on time. safely..  Can be able to print from Mobiles without need of a computer or laptop. Easy to self install.  would recommend........................................."
1057,30-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"After through study, I suggest this printer strongly. Because of the following features: Adv. 1. Wireless Printer - No need to connect printer with your laptop and tab 2. Cartridge is cheep (compared to Epson and Canon) 3. More pages per Cartridge  4. White Color is elegant than black 5. Print speed and Quality is good 6. At a time you can give print from more than one laptop  Dis Adv. 1. Wireless Configuration steps are not clear  2. More ink consumed in Color print"
1058,29-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"Pros: Wireless functionality is very handy. print picture quality is good if not great. Overall good & easy to handle.  Cons As white in color so dust prone. Its difficult to print in B&W ,may be I am not able to find correct settings."
1059,26-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I Got it delivered on 10th July 2014. It is a very good printer and love to own it. The prints and copies are of very good quality, it is east to install and commission.The wireless connectivity and Scan quality are also very good. For the cost of Rs.5300/- it is an excellant purchase.The yield of copies/prints per cartridge is yet to be assessed. But the cost of both cartridges quoted at the net also is reasonable."
1060,17-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,This product is good and main feature is wifi connectivity.It make my life easy.Experience with this item is really excellent..
1061,16-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,"I ordered this printer and a few cartridges. Flipkart seems to have been confused with the number of cartridges and sent me one extra, which arrived separately, and which I returned. So Flipkart needs to improve their tracking system for the orders.  The printer itself is good. The wireless capability lets me print stuff directly from my phone, tablet, etc. The print quality is reasonably good. How long the cartridge lasts is yet to be seen..."
1062,13-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,Good Printer in low price. Not compatible with Win XP SP3 (though XP driver is shipped with Printer and also published in official site).HP Wireless direct printing feature is good. HPs Tech support is not satisfactory. Packing is nice but Delivery time has increased from 3 days to 7days.
1063,11-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer is Highly recommended. Flipkart delivered on time.. The setup was easy and smooth.
1064,10-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I recently purchased this HP Wireless printer from flipkart and as always the service was great and received the printer in 3 days. Thanks to Flipkart.. Works great , received it in perfect condition, and in definitely much lesser price than the retail market. I hope Flipkart keeps up with this good work"
1065,01-Jul-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Flipkart service is so prompt delivered before than expected. Packaging very good it seems like they take as much care of the product as we the customers keep.  Thanks flipkart for the printer in so reasonable rate.
1066,28-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,4,I brought this printer one month ago and almost printed 300- 400 pages the print quality is good and easy to configure wifi connection between pc and printer.But printer paper jams after continously printing of 80 pages and you need to left the printer for some time after that so printer paper does not jam again.Overall i will say good printer.Very good for average home use.
1067,26-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"I was looking for a printer for average 100 to 125 prints a month. Initially thought of buying a lesserjet but price was a burden given the number of prints I would be doing..  I have 3 Laptops and a Desktop so when I looked at this printed, it had everything I needed..  Setup with a Windows 8.1 Laptop was easy and Wifi of this printer is very good and strong.. Once in network, other laptops and Desktop (they needed software install also) were able to print via WiFi network (connected via a TP Link WR740 router)..  I had trouble with Windows 7, since software given and downloaded (given in the website) was having problem, but HP Doctor downloaded the right files to solve the problem..  Cons :-  ** I mostly print B/W, and there quality is not at all close to a LesserJet ** HP phone support is very arrogant.. (Updt :- Emailing works better) ** You would need a Internet connection for the installation at-least since given CD and HP Website offline installers were useless for my windows 7 laptops.. (Download via web installer around 110mb) ** Scanner is kind of OK, no good bundled image processor either for scanned doc fixing.. ** Color Printing is costly if you are going for Photo Prints.. Photo printing is average..  Pros :-  ** Cheaper prints, Rs. 425 for a B/W cartridge, claims 450 pages but even 3/4 of that would be fine for me.. Compare to Cannon its almost 1/4 to 1/6 the cost.. ** WiFi is really good and Strong.. Network Printing is also a breeze.. ** Great for color docs and spreedshit.. ** Speed is excellent, felt like printing for LesserJet.. ** Boot up and ready time is also very fast.. ** One button COPY helps for occasional (xerox) copying job.. ** Scanner works in WiFi too.. Means anyone in the Network with the HP software can access the scanner too (wireless)  The thing I like the most is the WiFi networking of the printer, now anyone in my home can print :D.. What I hate though is the HP Cust Care, they were really arrogant and rude over the phone (Dont ask about their technical knowledge for T/S, i found it very amusing to hear their B/S).."
1068,26-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,Excellent Printer and Easy to us..  Loved it.. :)
1069,24-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,3,"Had read about the printer online when i decided to buy it. the printer was delivered promptly and in good packaging. Setup is easy though there is not much documentation accompanying the printer. All accessories were neatly packed. it is a compact printer upto A4 sizes. The printer is working without any issues, have used it standalone via usb and in network mode via wifi.  Disadvantages: no one touch button for scanning function."

1073,17-Jun-2014,HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2545 All-in-One Wireless Printer,5,"Its a great printer, with a decent per page printing cost. Each cartilage costs about INR 475, and can print about 450 - 500 pages in black and white ink. Whereas a colour cartilage costs the same, but can print only about 150 pages. Paper hast been jamming, and the noise is low too. The wifi printing too works smoothly. They have an app in the Google Play Store and the Apple App store, via which wifi printing is enabled. Not sure about windows though."

Flipkart needs to become price competitive."
