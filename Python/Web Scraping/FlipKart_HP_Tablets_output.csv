0,07-Nov-2014,HP 7 Voice Tab,5,"This is a Great device for Rs 10000. I got this from XSTechnologies, got delivery in 2 days, Thank you Flipkart.   I have been a samsung user for very long time, I got bored with Touchwiz. This tablet has a relatively clean Android 4.4 install. Their are only 2-3 HP apps.   The processor is relatvely fast for everyday use like video playback, internet, and light gaming. Heavy gamers and PPI addicts should stay away.  rear Camera quality is ok, though front camera could have been better, photography and  video calling is still better than my previous Galaxy Tab  To the people who are giving this Tablet 1 star rating, just because you get 4.7 GB out of 8 GB, This is the case with every mobile device in the world. If its your first smart device and you feel cheated, well grow up.  If you were to buy an 8gb Samsung Galaxy Grand, you will get 4 GB user available storage. Only the 8GB Iphone 4S offers a respectable 6.1 GB as user available storage but it doesnot have a micro sd card slot  I am using a 32 gb micro sd card with this tablet, which carries my TV Shows, and Music collection , my ebooks and photos. The 4.7 GB internal storage is enough for the 7-8 games and 10-12 other apps that I have installed. and I am still left with over 2.5 GB."
1,02-Nov-2014,HP 7 Voice Tab,4,"I have purchase this Tab from Croma on 16-Oct-2014, not from FlipKart.   I am here providing my genuine feedback after using this TAB for last 45 days, if anyone has any query may please contact me invincible.tambs(at)gmail.com.   This HP7 Voice Tab a quality product from the house of HP, Manufactured by HP-Singapore.  Processor : 1.3 GHz Quad Core ARMv7 Processor MT8382 QC A7 ( Good Performance) RAM : 1 GB ( 40% free usually) ROM : 8 GB ( User Available Memory for apps : 4.71 GB)  Primary Camera : 5MP with Flash, Camera is found to be OK Secondary Camera : 0.3M  Display: 6.95"" 600*1024 TN, 16.7M Transmissive LCD Touch: CTP, 5 point  It supports voice calling and 3G service with Single micro SIM slot  Direct Access Slot for Memory card., supports OTG  One Major Cons:  This tablet is based on stock Android 4.4 KitKat version, which removes the ability to write files to the MicroSD card by default and HP has forgotten to fix this issue, which makes the External SD card support read only and User gets no benefit of expansion of memory at all in terms of moving apps or change of storage location.  Further it also lacks built in Native File Manager which usually provided Write Access permission on External SD card.  Original Flip Cover Available at HP Store's and Online HP Shopping Website @ Rs. 1299/-  Quality of flip cover is good and no proper screen guard available in market as of now.   At this price level , this seems to be good quality product with Kitkat 4.4.2 but lack expandability of memory due to write permission issue.  PS: I have edited my review & downgraded my rating based on the major drawback observed w.r.t. lack of write permission and expandability of memory, which is a basic need."

5,04-Feb-2015,HP 7 Voice Tab,5,"I have purchased this product from ebay on discount at Rs.8,400/- 3 months earlier when i purchase the product except the screen quality, everything I liked and worked as expected and there were no issues while exploring the tablet but after a while i found sd card write support within the tablet is disable but you can write on the sd card after connecting it to the computer after a while i started to figure out rooting my tablet but there is no method available on the Internet to root this tablet but to my surprise today i have got an update from hp and it was approx 146 mb after installation of this upgrade now i can copy move and delete the files in sd card within the tablet so now everything is fixed so thank you HP for providing this beautiful product in such a affordable price. Though it's not a perfect tablet but on such a price it definitely deserve 5 stars. ?"

13,27-Mar-2015,HP 7 Voice Tab,3,"Hi guys,, Phone is look nice and very big. However, the worst part is its front camera, you cant even able to see your face in a open ground,, may be its a manufacturing defect or phone comes like that. Only go for this phone for call and message and browsing,, camera part is worst."
14,27-Mar-2015,HP 7 Voice Tab,3,"I am using this tab since 4 months and got it replaced twice due to battery charging issue. When the battery drains completely, this tab is not getting charged again. Contacyed the service center, they checked the tab and confirmed problem in motherboard and replaced my Tab. this happened twice. Rest all others good."
15,21-Mar-2015,HP 7 Voice Tab,4,"I order it on 24 Feb and received it on 27 packaging of the tab was very nice.  Pros 7 inch screen  5 mp rear cam is good Video quality  Sound quality Quad core processor is good , I play some high-mid games and it runs perfectly  Cons Front cam is worst Battery life is average  Overall it is a very nice tab in this price range but this tab is not for selfi fans"
16,18-Mar-2015,HP 7 Voice Tab,3,"I am not sure if the videos i am playing are not enough with the required resolution for this tab, the video quality is very poor. Please advise if i have to look for any video formats or is really the video quality for this product is BAD?"

21,28-Jan-2015,HP 7 Voice Tab,3,i received the tab . tab looks very good and has a decent display. internal memory fro use is around 4 GB out of 8 GB. but when i am shaking the phone in hand some sound is coming from inside . may be battery loosely fitted or somthing.. so if some one has already faced the same problem kindly share this problem.other wise the performance is good.
22,22-Jan-2015,HP 7 Voice Tab,5,"I have purchased this tab after evaluating with samsung, asus & xolo tabs. I am fully satisfied with this tab/phablet."
23,16-Jan-2015,HP 7 Voice Tab,5,"The design is Very good . Speakers are loud Enough . Display has wide Viewing angles . Though the PPI is not that great . Good Processor . 1gb Ram for Everyday usage is Enough.  Battery Backup is Awesome . Mid- High Games like Asphalt 8 , Dead trigger 2 , Six guns.  Run perfectly on this Device .Rear Camera is Good But Front Camera is Below Average . Below 15k I would Recommend HP Voice Tab 7 ."
24,10-Jan-2015,HP 7 Voice Tab,4,Writing this after using for a month. Purchased it from HP online store because they are giving 2000rs worth Myntra coupons. Nice voice tab as name states.  Pros :  Display - 4/5 Speakers - 4.5/5 Touch - 4/5 Speed : 4/5 Build : 4/5 Internet speed : 4/5  Cons :  Camera Front : 1.5/5 Camera Rear : 3/5 Charge : 10 hours if you are games freak and browsing. If only calls then comes for a day.  Excellent voice tab at this price can go for it.
25,09-Jan-2015,HP 7 Voice Tab,5,i am happy to have it. so far no problem. its have big screen thats what i need. and i am happy bcoz i like hp products :)  its bit heavy so not good for gals... but for big guys like me.. its good one.
26,07-Jan-2015,HP 7 Voice Tab,5,"THE TAB ARRIVED IN A DAY ,THE FIRST LOOK AT WAS STUNNING,THE TOUCH IS VERY RESPONSIVE,MOUNTED WITH A GLASS LIKE TOUCH,ITS VERY SLEEK AND STUNNING,PROCESSING IS VERY QUICK AS IT COMES EQUIPPED WITH A 1GB OF RAM,BROWSING BECOMES VERY CONVENIENT WITH AN OVEL MOUNT EDGES PERFECT TO HOLD IN THE HAND,ALTHOUGH THE CAMERA IS NOT AS GOOD AS EXPECTED ITS QUITE GOOD AT DAY LIGHT IMAGING,THE SENSORS WORK QUITE GOOD AND ITS A BEST CHOICE IF WANTED UNDER 10000 RUPEES,IF WANTED TO BUY IN OTHER STORES ITS EXPENSIVE THAN THE PRICING OF FLIPKART. THE BOTTOM LINE OF THE REVIEW IS THAT ITS A GOOD CHOICE IF YOU ARE WANTING THIS HP 7 VOICE TAB"
27,31-Dec-2014,HP 7 Voice Tab,5,"dear flipkart,  kindly launch the flipcover for hp7 voice tab with exact size.  please make it avail as soon as possible"
28,25-Dec-2014,HP 7 Voice Tab,5,"- Good device within price range of 10 K, best combination of phone and tablet  - Purchased it for 10,299 from flipkart   - Got Myntra gift card worth Rs. 2,000 also which was utilized while buying stuff from Myntra (you need to fill up online redemption form, gift card is emailed within a week by HP)  - Easy to hold  - Secondary camera is useless  - Primary camera (5 MP) - produces average pictures. If you are concerned with camera quality buy high end phones which cost more than 20K. HP has provided 5 MP camera in this device which is normal in this price range. You will get 2 MP camera in Samsung Tablets which cost around 20,000 !  - I am really surprised why some customers say volume is very less. It seems that they have not used the device. The fact is that volume is so high that you cannot hear music and FM radio at full volume with headset provided by HP. So is the case with call volume.   - Setting ringtones of your choice might be difficult for some of you. If you have received ringtone through bluetooth/whatsapp/PC/Laptop etc, you need to first install HP File Manager and then go to relevant folder(music/bluetooth etc) in HP file manager and then copy the ringtone(s) and then go to ringtone folder and then click on paste. After doing this, when you change handset ringtone in setting>sound, you will find ringtones in the list of sounds  - HP Support service is very good. You just connect you device to internet and then click on HP Support app in ur device, you will be connected to chat specialist who can assist you with any problem you experience and provide solution for the same.  - Don't buy HP Flip cover which costs Rs. 1299 from HP Website because it is big for this device. Leather portion from all sides is coming out which creates problems while holding the phone.  - Screen protector is available on flipkart.   In nutshell, except camera quality, it is not less than my samsung galaxy note"
29,18-Dec-2014,HP 7 Voice Tab,4,I read a review saying no Scratchguard available. Well here goes and it's availabe at Flipkart.  http://www.flipkart.com/karpine-scr10069matte-screen-guard-hp-7-voice-tab/p/itmefyy3v7fqhk9j?pid=ACCEFYY35DDVPAG3
30,17-Dec-2014,HP 7 Voice Tab,1,"This is by far the worst product I've used, I never thought that HP would launch such a product.   Flipkart service is of course The Best in terms of service, but I did not have time to order it here and wait for the delivery, so I paid 1000rs extra in the HP IT world and purchased it, and it came out to be a defective one. The Circuit board was shaking inside the tablet, batery back up was less than an hr even if not in use, data conections was not working, so I had to run around from the store to service centre on and off several times, finally they replaced a new piece.   However the product is so crapy, camera quality is so worst for 5MP, worst than VGA, in low light it is pathetic! Hardware quality is so cheap, display is also like a cheap China phone, speakers sound quality and volume is so low. I did not check the performance yet, I don't think it will be of any good too. I would strongly recommend not to go for this product, I would not even give 1 star for this."
31,01-Dec-2014,HP 7 Voice Tab,5,I purchased this tab 10300/- in outside store and got 2000/- worth myntra coupons as well.Performance is too good only problem is right now no covers available for this product. --Display is super --very good design --Battery backup is ok --25GB inbox storage
32,21-Nov-2014,HP 7 Voice Tab,4,Its a nice tab. No lag in asphalt 8 and other games. 4 star because of camera.Camera is not up to the mark. Back camera is fine but bad flash and the front camera is only for name. This tablet gives you a better performance.
33,18-Nov-2014,HP 7 Voice Tab,3,I am Buying HP 7 Voice Tab. I Received And Open the Box. When I Am Checking My Tab Is Not Working & Software Is Not Update And All The Apps Are Not Downloading Properly. Really I Am Suffered. I Went To Hp Service Centre. They Said The Tab is Not Working Condition. We Will Give You The Conformation Letter From where You Buy Please Return The Tab Immediately. Guys Please Don't Buy HP Tab Product Beware. Its Very Very Useless Product.

35,06-Nov-2014,HP 7 Voice Tab,4,Why the heck is its screen guard and flip cover not available in market why only at HP secvice Center.. -_- But Overall The Product is Very Good in its Performance..

38,31-Oct-2014,HP 7 Voice Tab,5,TABLET WITH FLASE IS THE FIRST tablet. wow nice mobile camera qualite is too good  it's prosses is very easy
39,22-Oct-2014,HP 7 Voice Tab,5,"I haven't heard anyone talking non-sense about this tab, they like the quality, brand, working, no heating issues, works like a charm  But My question is,  1. Why is this not on GSM Arena?  2. Is this a a HP slate 7 Voice Tab's single sim version, are they same?  Please answer guys is there anything BAD about this tab?"
40,17-Oct-2014,HP 7 Voice Tab,5,I would like to know whether this tablet can play Full HD video i.e 1080p. Anyone please reply..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
41,14-Aug-2014,HP 10 Tabl,3,"Got the Tab few days back and observed that the USB port adjacent to HDMI port doesn't work. Thought this might get resolved through patch updates but no luck so far. Moreover the devices product code, part number, serial tag sticker is missing and unable to register this device with HP for Warranty support; Infact I struggled a lot to find a mention of this product in HP websites. Camera is pathetic and the device shows 764 MB RAM (instead of 1 GB). The product is quite heavy too if one intends to hold it to use without any support.  This plays movies and multiple games in parallel quite well but with faulty USB port, dead weight, missing warranty information, not sure if this is worth the cost.  Suggest to look for alternates and keep watching for future review/updates as I struggle to clarify on Warranty and seeking replacement from Flipkart.  --- Got replacement without any hassles and the new Tablet had serial number sticker. Flipkart also provided revised invoice with serial number. The problem with USB port continues in new Tablet too. Seems this USB port is not meant for data transfer and HP service desk is checking further. No other issues with this tablet otherwise. ---- Final Update (3 Sep'14) Got confirmation from HP support team that one of the USB ports is meant only for keyboard/mouse and not for data transfer. So in effect there's only 1 USB port for data transfer (and this is used for charging too).  Flipkart team should check on this and change product information appropriately highlighting that only 1 USB port works for data."
42,05-Sep-2014,HP 10 Tabl,1,Pros: Nothing  Cons: USB Slot Doesn't work. An already used piece was shipped. Memory Card Slot doesnt Work. Performance Sucks. Display Sucks. Suitable Cases/Covers not available in the market. Screen Guard Not available in the market. Fragile SIM Slot.  Just a piece of metal and glass. Thanks to flipkart for accepting my request for return. I have now ordered Digiflip Pro for which also I see lot of negative reviews. I pray that people who are planning to buy this tab should read this review and I request them to go for some branded Tablets.  This Product is not even worth for 5000 Rs.  P.S. I usually don't give very harsh reviews like this. But I couldn't control myself writing a review like this.
43,30-Sep-2014,HP 10 Tabl,4,"The MRP of this product is 20K. If you buy it at this price people will classify you as a moron. But buy it from flipkart at 13K, and you will save yourself a lot of public redicule!  With that said, I would like to point out that if your budget can stretch by a few grands more, BUY SOMETHING ELSE. But if you are 'poor' like me, this is a good choice.   I am a teacher and in the past one month I have found its best utility as a laptop/desktop replacement for giving presentations in class. Just like a laptop, I connect to the projector using WiFi. I can also connect the projector using the mini HDMI port. I have used it in two conferences and have had no issues when I needed to make minor modifications to the presentation. Kingsoft is awesome! (I am also given to understand that there are a few Latex/Beamer editors for Android, though I have never tried using any.)  The battery is decent, but nothing to brag about. With full charge, it would last for a couple of days on standby (flight mode). But if I play Gunship Battle Helicopter it dies out in less than 3 hours. I get to watch about 4.5 hours of movies with full charge.  The screen is an average one. But IMO it is not a deal breaker. I have read hundreds of pages of research papers and student assignments on it and never had a problem. Use it with airplane mode and the battery will last for 24-36 hours.  Points to note: 1. The memory card was not detected initially. But as soon as I connected the tablet to WiFi it showed that a number of updates were ready to be downloaded. After the updates everything was working perfectly. (I couldn't find a preinstalled file explorer, so I downloaded ES File Explorer. Now I can access my files and folders directly.) 2. If you play a lot of games with high visual effects, is tablet is definitely NOT for you. You will hate the battery, and, maybe, the processor too. 3. It comes with no bloatware, and very few preinstalled apps. 4. It is great for reading book and papers. 5. The front camera is OK for video conferencing. 6. But the biggest problem with this tablet is not the tablet itself, but the fact that you will not find any accessory for it anywhere. The tablet cases available in flipkart are actually generic 11"" cases. I have not yet found a screen guard. I am using a flip-fold case which I purchased from shopclues for Rs. 299. But the height-width ratio don't match with that of the tablet, and about an inch of the tablet sticks out of the case. But this has been advantageous as I can directly take pictures without having to take off the case. (I do not encourage people to take pictures with this gadget. Use your DSLR, or your phone instead.)  If anyone has any idea about a screen guard which I might be able to use please let me know."
44,11-Jan-2014,HP 10 Tabl,5,"HP Looks to speed ahead on the Tabs toooo.  Late entrant but superb product, Bought this product in the offline but ,is a great buy...  Once switched on it showed some new update for new re partitions followed by a stability update.. I updated the system.. works flawless n very stable.. Processing speed is Excellent,and great for multi tasking...Use it for Excel sheets,video ,and social media all at once,worked stable and great experience Happy wit its performance.."
45,10-Aug-2014,HP 10 Tabl,4,"I got this product delivered on 25.07.2014. Simply super tab. I mainly ordered this for the size - 10 inch. after one month of research from various online shopping sites, finally landed up in this. its really worth wait.  Pros:  * display clarity * speaker * speed  * size - ideal for elders and kids  Cons: * as expected - camera quality. But still appreciations as it performs decently in day light. * weight - slightly heavy . But survives harsh handling by 2 yr old kid. Will get used for carrying in a day or two. * not compatible for few apps like viber , taking tom etc.  * very few per installed apps  overall a very good product from a big brand at a good size and affordable price . Service, packaging by flipkart were excellent as usual. Almost every product from flipkart gets delivered at least 3- 4 days ahead the delivery date."
46,16-Jul-2014,HP 10 Tabl,5,"Very good to use. Value for money. Very Useful for reading and seeing videos Net speed is remarkable. Playing games are very interesting. I recommend all to purchase This product with full confidence. There is only one negative is, voice calling is not Available in this device. It is not a major issue. Thanking for flipkart service."
47,11-Sep-2014,HP 10 Tabl,5,"I bought it through Flipkart and got the delivery in spotless condition. Thanks for that.  About the tab. For 13000 bucks, it is difficult to imagine a better 10 inch tab. I say this because, HP has got a brand value as well.  The built and feel is good enough. Touch is really responsive. Speed is fine. What stands out is the battery life. My niece plays games many hours a day, still I did not have to charge the tab even once in two days. I've applied a screen guard from a local shop and bought a leather pouch as well. The Tab easily handles all my jobs, such as email, skype, browsing, reading and movie watching.  Overall, very happy."
48,01-Sep-2014,HP 10 Tabl,1,"Crap, Outdated, waste of money. Please don't buy this n waste yo money. there are much better tabs at this range. dont choose this."
49,16-Jan-2015,HP 10 Tabl,5,"My wife works as a teacher in govt. school and wanted a tablet . Need was for a 10"" screen, as the use was in the classroom, meanwhile didn't wanted to take risk with costlier tablets ( you know the how these kids handle it ) . After a long research I zeroed in on HP 10. I got scared after reading few reviews, Rs. 10899 for a 10"" tablet that too HP brand and with SIM slot ?? I ordered on Sunday and waited for a monkey ( if you throw peanut.. ). I was quite anxious and I paid Rs. 90 extra for next day delivery. Got a prompt delivery on 12/1/14 and I was into a pleasant surprise !!   It is decent package. We have been using for a week and didn't utter ""oh sh.."" even once. We have downloaded many apps, games, movies and tested. I'm happy with speed, display and battery performance . It may not compete with its richer brothers and cousins, but does it job pretty well. Believe me, for peanuts I didn't get a money, but a good tablet indeed. Planning to buy one for my 8 years old son and gift another to my brother's daughter.  I have rated the product 5 star in its range of price and screen size. Swift and Landrover shouldn't be compared on the same scale you see.  If I write more, I may sound like someone from HP marketing.   This product seems to be available only through e-retailing. Not through any of the brick & mortar showrooms, including HPs. Does that matter ? At least not for me."
50,02-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,1,"HP seems real interested in getting movie stars to advertise for their products. However, they seem to have great difficulty in getting their basics right.   I called up the help desk to check on whether they had any updates to the issue of the non-working USB port. This seems to a constant theme across all complaints posted on Flipkart. It was extremely annoying to have to be transferred 3 times amongst different departments. The real shocker was when the help desk guy couldn't recognize a product that he is supposed to support. Needless to say, the port still does not work and no updates have been issued yet.   Thankfully the microSD card works.   I own a Nexus 7 as well. After almost 2 years it still works like a charm.   With this tablet, you get what you pay for. No wonder it's selling at 13k. They have probably rounded up all tablets that weren't selling someplace else and dumped them here. I would henceforth be extremely cautious while buying HP products."
51,01-Nov-2014,HP 10 Tabl,4,Feared until it is delivered because of the reviews written against it. Delivered on the the date of the of delivery mentioned by Flipkart. Both the USB do not give trouble.  It works fine. Bought it because of its screen size. Bought it as a replacement for the mini laptop because of its weight for my journey outside my hometown. Hope this will suffice me as a hybrid between laptop and tablet for the present work that I am involve with. It will not be right for me to complain when I bought a 10 inch tablet for Rs. 9899/-
52,26-Sep-2014,HP 10 Tabl,5,Looks good and works good. I recommend this product.  I have not yet gotten any Problem and expecting good working condition in future
53,30-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,1,"Brought HP 10 Tab on the mega sale -6th october.. The charging port is not working .Since it is within the replacement period , The Flipkart executive says that there is no stock therefore no replacement. But the flipkart website shows availability of HP10 tab. Amazing Flipkart......"
54,16-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,1,"It seems flipkart is not taking any responsbilitynto verify the products which are getting delivered.   I am asking one simple question.   I recived a tablet which i orderd. My model number mentioned on the bill matches with the model name on official website,However my product name which is printed on tablet does not match with the same official website.   I complained on customer care yesterday. They said they will arrange call back for me however no response yet.   I demand immediate answer. It seems this is not genuine product. No where I can find this product name on official website And you can't sell duplicate product saying its 100% genuine."
55,07-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,1,"It is an ok product for the money, but the SD card is not usable. The table doesn't allow you to create folder from your computer. Also doesn't mount the card automatically if the tablet is restarted. The card needs to ejected and plugged back in to be recognised, and that too in ready only access."
56,01-Sep-2014,HP 10 Tabl,2,"My tablet is not able to read and write from SD card. Tried 2 different SD cards. These cards works on other phone and card reader but not in this tablet. Asked for replacement. It's my 1st replacement request from flipkart. let's see how things works. Some apps not works on this tablet like Google hangout does not support camera in this tablet. this problem may be related to this piece only. lets see, will give feedback if i receive a new piece. other crons - a little heavier side. but price is good."
57,25-Jul-2014,HP 10 Tabl,4,"It may not be Amazing like claimed in a earlier review but it works well. The Camera is just a So-So. You are stuck with 4.1.2 JB version of android. This is NOT HP Slate 10 HD, although the specs are quite similar. The weird part is the 2x USB ports. The USB port right next to the HDMI port does not seem to work. I thought this was a problem with the unit I got. Flipkart even sent me a very quick replacement (awesome service, by the way), but it just does not seem to work. The data transfer rate via the other working USB port is horrible. I think works at around USB 1.1 speeds.  For ex. Transferring 4 GB of data takes around 40 mins.  The best parts i like with this tablet: - Very responsive touch screen - 3G works well with Normal Sim (you do not need a micro sim) - 10.1' diagonal screen is just right for me. (very nice for watching widescreen vids) - Audio is not bad. (but not Beats audio like HP 10 Slate HD or the old HP TouchPad)"
58,08-Nov-2014,HP 10 Tabl,2,"does not have kitkat does not get updates does not have a good performance does not support full hd does not have a suitable screen guard does not have good design does not have a light weight body does not get customer support once you mention you are calling for support for a hp tab 10 does not have a good warranty period DON'T BUY IT, SAVE YOURSELF"
59,06-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,1,"Hey team....you people have done it again ....why you people have increased the price again this time, when people of India is flooded with many offers. This product is not worth of the price you are offering now. This is CHEATING to the people of India. Please don't do this. Zilch Star for this."
60,13-Sep-2014,HP 10 Tabl,5,"I had worst experience with Flipkart, First I bought Tab, SD Card slot was not working, The display looks like china mobile, the charger pin is not intact It took a week for flipkart to get back to me, When i asked for refund. They said its not possible and they gonna replace it with another carp piece of the same Do no buy any Electronic items form this site, Even if it cost couple of bucks less."
61,29-Aug-2014,HP 10 Tabl,5,"Just second day of use. My first impression, this product meets my expectation. Just Value for Money.  My primary use is  1. Reading 2. Watching YouTube videos 3. Emailing 4. To some extend chatting.  Product is light weight and looks sturdy too..  Will write back in this space after a month and revisit my comments. Also share some more experiences.  Flipkart delivery is the best. No one could match it till today."

I order HP 10 Tablet, and this is just awesome, touch is great, accessing speed is very fast. Once you switch on the Tablet, it shows new update for all apps. I updated the system. Works exceptionally fast. Processing speed is Excellent and great for multi tasking.  Overall it can be 5 star, but i take 1 star back because of Camera. It should be better. If you want to take pictures or make videos, please use other gadget like DSLR or your Mobile."
71,05-Feb-2015,HP 10 Tabl,4,Its is a very good tab. Value for money. 1st piece supplied had some net connectivity problem. Flipkart replaced it even after the 30 days guarantee period. The next one is working very good.
72,31-Jan-2015,HP 10 Tabl,4,"the product i found fine for me, i bought it for my parents to be used for talking to me on skype.... the tab works smoothly...at-least it good for neophytes like my parents.  there are some cons as well...  1) camera, as usual for all tabs, is not of a good quality, for this tab, camera takes video looks too dark 2) its a bit heavy.. .but off-course for this size it may be acceptable if you dont hold it for long 3) Difficult to find standing cover in market for this tab  If you are fine with these cons, go and buy it. I am 80% satisfied with this this product"

85,11-Dec-2014,HP 10 Tabl,1,"I recently bought a HP 10 tablet in July 2014 from Flipkart. Flipkart delivery was excellent. In the month of October, something went wrong with the tablet and it doesn't even start. I took the tablet in your HP service centre in NOIDA named JABIL, and they return the tablet after 3 weeks, which does not perform as it used before. I drop the tablet again at the service center on Friday- 4th December to resolve the issue. Its been full one week and still they aren't able to resolve the issue. I am completely dissatisfied with the service of HP and product of HP. Guys please dont buy products of HP."

88,19-Nov-2014,HP 10 Tabl,3,"The product is working well as expected, my daughter love to play with this. however it is little heavy and display is not up to the mark. HP could have provided better screen resolution given it is 10 inch display. Also it is hard to find the case for this tablet.  I can only give 3 star to this tab.   Please let me know if some one find a compatible case for this tab."
89,08-Nov-2014,HP 10 Tabl,5,"I purchased this product 20 days before. working well. can connect to TV through HDMI out put. TV output is great. Can view Youtube, gmail, anything in TV. Thanks to HP providing this product for less cost with great features."
90,01-Nov-2014,HP 10 Tabl,1,"Please don't buy it beacause  1.It has a sim slot but so poor network reception that you have to sit on mobile tower for network reception in it. It shows zero network bar even when Nokia XL shows Full bar. I tried sim cards of all gsm operator but same problem. 2.After 10 days of use it stopped working. No response.Next day it started automatically. 3.After 20 Days its screen stopped working. 4. No warranty support as i checked on hp website.  At first Flipkart rejected my request for return but ultimately Flipkart returned it. I appreciate excellent costumer services buy Flipkart I am very sad and I don't want you to be, So please don't buy it even if it is being sold at one thousand rupees."

THANK GOD FLIPKART HAS ONE MONTH RETURN POLICY. I PACKED THE PRODUCT AS IT IS WHEN I GOT, AND NOW WAITING FOR FLIPKART PERSON TO COME AND PICK THE PRODUCT FROM PLACE."
94,20-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,5,Excellent product for the price (mrp of 20k is unjustified. Got it for less than 10k on flipkart). Excellent packaging and delivery as ususal by flipkart. Display very good. Sound quality not as good as ipad but good enough.
95,19-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,1,"Booked tab on said big billion day.  Found same problems as faced by most reviewers.  USB slot not working. Not reading memory card.   Even not able to transfer file to tab internal memory.   Disappointed. Requested for replacement. Let's see.    Bye bye HP. If they would have been serious, they must have learnt from previous reviews. It seems almost every second buyer has seeked replacement.  Feeling guilty for big billion day - can't get money back.  Pls consider reviews seriously before buying."
96,18-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,1,Flipkart has given discount on big billion day sale with the price of 9999 and next day shows the prices as around 19k slowly now giving on 10999. Means it was a big game to fool customers. Although the product has not reached till date.With all false tracking information and several calls and promise it is still undelivered. I shifted the place and the order address cann't be changed as per them because it has been shipped as per their comment. But actually it is not shipped til now. zero point actually to flipkart. and amazingly they say my pin code (received mail on the promised delivery date) is incorrect. Amazing flop show.
97,16-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,3,Its worth to buy a tablet at this price (10k - 13k). I strongly recommend you are the first time users of tablet. pls start with this.
98,15-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,4,"The tab is awesome if you are looking for reading books, editing documents & some low end games.  This is surely not for you if you want to take pictures with it or play high graphic games.  The internal memory available for user is 5.75 GB, if an SD card is added it gets stuck, so basically 5.75 GB is all what you will get. I ordered it for its size and for its prize on big billion day which was 9k, its a very good buy if you get it at that price. First when I got the device the ports were not working, got it replaced and now the replaced device works fine. If you buy it make sure you update it before draining the battery. 4 stars just because of the price I bought it, 9k. If you are planning to buy at its usual rate which is 14k, don't!! You will regret it later... Go for some other device."
99,12-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,5,one of the best tablet which i have used  its features at this particular price is awesome and on important thing is it is a product of one of the best brand in the world so i will suggest this to everyone.
100,11-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,4,Probably i am one of the luccky customers on big billion day. Excellent product and shipped in 2 days! Enjoying the brand new and HP authorized product.
101,10-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,1,"Better go for Dell venue 7 ,3G model. That tab is within budget and performs way better than any tab in price range of upto Rs 20,000."
102,10-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,3,"I got this tab in 9999 DAT to within 3 days. For this amount its worth enough. I am not a die hard gamer so this tab budgetwise+ configuration suits my taste. Tab finishing is good I am afraid of the finishing touch and edges..Its good for watching videos, surfing, and reading books and attending online lectures... Most of the android tabs won't support flash player but there is always a loop hole which you need to find, search in net and your job will be done. Battery takes 2 hrs to charge fully ..it will run for 5-6 hrs video or 8-9 hrs music+ netsurfing once fully charged which I liked the most.   I bought this because of price + 10 inch screen size + HP brand. If you buy 7 inch tab also you can't carry it..go for big...  Only drawback its heavy(mini laptop) also you won't get flip cover for this easily. Also I don't know y m unable to register my product in HP registration portal. Have to talk to HP support team regarding this."
103,10-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,4,It is worth for money. I couldn't get the screen guard and case cover. Performance is very good. Camera quality is not good
104,09-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,4,"Really Thankful to Flipkart for Big Billion day program  Performance of this tab is good, but some of its features are not working like additional USB port is not connecting and Bluetooth is not working at all.  Apart from the above rest all is working fine, it suites very well for Movies, Pictures, video callings, Games & browsing picture & sound clarity is amazing.  Battery is also fine, its not getting heat while charging are using it for long time also.  Good at this price segment and for branded lovers go for it really value for money  Krishna"
105,07-Oct-2014,HP 10 Tabl,1,wrost product i ever seen hp 10 .so my advice is dont't buy it 's look like very cheap china product......so i don't want say more .who is reading this plesssss don't buy .because i am regretting now .so i don't want to other people do same.plesss
106,27-Sep-2014,HP 10 Tabl,4,"i have been using this tab for last 1 month. really happy with this tab. battery back is almost 10 hours, responsive touch, fast and smooth functions. but camera quality is not good at all but you get what you pay for. but seriously guys this is worth buy."
107,26-Sep-2014,HP 10 Tabl,4,"Good performance for this price. Cant get a 10 inch tab at this price. But u have to compromise the screen clarity which is low at 160PPI. As many other reviews shows, one of the USB port does not work. think it is a dummy here, that is used in higher end models.  Received product in 4 days. Packaging was good and secure.  One big disadvantage is the weight of the tablet. if u use it for about half an hour, you fell like keeping it down because ur hand pains. Better buy a case / stand.  Camera - Rear - Pretty bad - not even a VGA. Front - Cannot say anything - not usable.  That too indoor photos are very bad.  But afterall at this price u cant expect any tab with 10 inch screen and 3G sim."
108,19-Sep-2014,HP 10 Tabl,4,it is best tablet in its class....i bought this frm flipkart...n using from 2 months......its good n very much usefull

113,24-Jul-2014,HP 10 Tabl,3,"Quite good for reading pdfs, ebook which is my primary aim for this tablet. however the build is quite poor and the ports are misaligned. the battery performance is poor, the aspect ratio is not too good either. However three weeks into getting the product, its utility is quite great, but that is just the idea of tablet and not THIS tablet. I had seen an micromax large screen device in an showroom that looks and feels better as far as short term usage was concerned. This should be priced cheaper than Rs 15k now, would be a worth buy for Rs 10k. Some issues with SD card as well, need to connect when system is on, need to reconnect after a reboot."

115,12-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"Flipkart Review: 1. As part of Go Green Initiative, Flipkart no longer give hard copies of Invoice. However i am surprised not to have received even soft copy after three calls and one mail. It is four days now and no mention of Invoice from Flipkart. In malls i have often read board ""Item Free If No Bill !"" Is is applicable even here ;-) ? 2. In order to promote One and Same day delivery, i have noticed delay in standard delivery timelines.  Update: Just communicated with Flipkart to understand the reason for failure to provide me Invoice Copy. Was surprised with the attitude of Executive who said THAT IT IS ACCEPTABLE AND COMMON TO MISS INVOICE COPY AS COMPANY DOES 1 LAKH TRANSACTIONS A DAY. Executive refused to take a complaint and also denied taking feedback to improve. Wonder has Flipkart ever heard of Six Sigma ?  HP Voice Tab Review: 1. Voice clarity is terrific. 2. Poor Camera. 3. Tab can be connected to system as Mass Media Device and not as USB Device which is common in many android devices. This results in slow transfer rates. 4. No sluggishness or slowness of device. Smooth like butter. Standard Default Android UI used. 5. Front speakers are great and nice to watch movie."
116,02-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"I think i have done a mistake by buying this product in Flipkart. Many issues has come up on this tab. Firstly with small games and videos also the tab is getting hanged up. everything even on skype the tab gets hanged. even with subway sufer game and temple run game also it gets hanged. i went to HP service there was no response from them, they state it was in good condition. i kept a return request in Flipkart and it was also denied. i dont understand what i have to do with this useless piece."
117,22-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Bought this tab and it froze after a few weeks of regular use, it froze. I guess this can happen to any electronic product, as long as there are not too many such cases seen, given that millions are manufactured and few can be faulty. What I want to highlight is that the replacement service of Flipkart / WS Retail is too good. I received the replacement within 2 days - no questions asked, no hassles or long waits. I have bought many items from WS Retail and this was the first time I had to ask for a replacement. And the experience gave more faith that this is a very dependable seller.  The replacement tab is working perfectly fine and I guess it will continue to be so. HP has come out with a wonderful combination of specs at a pretty lucrative price point. Performance is great and with the 3G SIM capability, it just adds on to the bang."
118,17-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"I got the HP voicetab jus today and I didnt get the tablet from Flipkart, i got it from the HP online store. the main reason i got a tab is i wanted to watch videos and browse and i didnt want to use my phone for that as dese functions will drain the battery soon. My initial choices were Xolo tegranote, Galaxy tab3 7-inch, Dell venue 8, Nexus 2012  Pros :  - Has Dual Sim capability (2G+3G)  - Has a dashing premium finish/Easy to hold and make calls.  - Decent Display & has good viewing angles  - internal memory of 16GB which u dont get at this price  - expandable memory using MicroSD  - front-firing speakers  - 4000 Mah battery   - has a in-ear headset (provided in the package itself) for making calls which is pretty good   - runs on stock android so updates wont take much longer  Cons :  - Under-powered processor (1.2 GHZ Quad-core)  - only 1GB RAM which is no enuf for some ppl  - the tab is a little too thick for my taste  I have used i for a complete day and this is my observation. I tried o play HD videos, it worked fine. i wud have given it a 5-star if only the processor was a lil more faster. but in this price range is actually a worthy tab, and better than many brands and also is a HP product, so trustable. Go for it is what i would say"
119,18-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"In a nutshell its a great Phablet which has value for money. Go for it.  What is Good:  a. Good Finish b. Decent screen resolution c. 1GB RAM d. Quad core process or with GPU built in ( Tested with couple of games and performance is pretty good) e. GPS is pretty accurate and able to capture signal pretty fast f. Front firing speakers audio is pretty good g. Audio through headset is decent h. Nice power adapter is provided for external charging and can be charged through USB i. Product lives by the brand HP j. Pretty sleek and good finish k. Great battery and holds charge decently l. Comes with all basic required software and some apps from India today group m. Best in the market for this price  Could have been better:  a. Decent audio when we use it directly, can be little louder b. Screen could have been more sensitive to sunlight. Need film else get glare c. Could have provided a folding cover. We need to purchase everything as add on d. Reconsider if you want to use it as phone directly ( Suggest to use Bluetooth or headset)"
120,24-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,2,"First of all, a very timely n safely Product Delivery by Flipkart. Hats off to your booking, pricing, shipment procedure. Price wise you people are always reliable and best in class.  Huge disappointment as brand Hp did not worked on many things to satisfy some basic needs which any Voice Tab can provide. 1. Very poor network reception. One has to switch off phone several times to catch the network again. Even a little drop in network strength vanishes phone's connectivity regarding data as well as call. Hp must work hard on this issue as phone has no re reception of network. 2. Battery can't last for a single day or full 12 hours. 3. Sound profiles haven't introduced, thus every time one has to press main on-off key to silent the phone. 4. Can't Personalize menu or settings as per requirement. Absence of User friendly shortcuts creates time consumption and confusion. 5. Very low voice output. Earphones are also not effective.  But if one can ignore these defects, rest all features are superb. 1. Picture, Video, Touch, Look, Display everything superb. 2. Finishing too good. 3. Clarity of Sound hats off, just need to improve voice level. 4. Typing, Text support, Text input all best in class. 5. Storage is huge n sufficient.  HP can do much better than this as all these features are exists in laptop n desktops, where HP is master n ahead of all. So always expecting more from Hp."
121,16-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,2,"1. Product is more than Rs. 500 cheaper in Amazon site. Compare before placing order. 2. About Tab, in nutshell, neither good nor bad. 3. Samsung Tab3 looks better. 4. Charging problem. It gets stopped while using Tab. 5. HP Case/ cover is not easily available in market. 6. Display quality less attractive. Key pads are dull especially dialling buttons. 7. Back cover quality is also poor."
122,01-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"I recently bought it from Flipkart.  A good product from HP @ the reasonable price.  Pros:  > Light weight and very handy. > Quality of making was good. > Awesome music play with headset. > Recommended for browsing and Movies only. > Battery backup is very good. > internal storage for User available is arround 13 GB. > Cloud storage of 25 GB for lifetime.  Cons: > Lacks of powerful processor. > Not suitable for gaming.  Temple Run2 - no performance impact.  Hill Climb racing - There is a performance issue, when we play with sound enabled in the game. > No flash for camera. > Camera quality is not as expected. > HD display is not so impressed, maybe requires gorilla glass.  Overall the product was good and more features for this price,but we cannot compare it with high end devices."
123,22-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"First i am very thankful to FLIPKART.com, service is very excellent, day by day improving your service,very great service. They delivered me on time. I ordered the item on 18th may, & i received the itemon 21st may........

It is much better than SAMSUNG tab3. it is Dual sim option   SIM 1:- 2g & 3g & it is mini sim  SIM 2:- only 2g it is regular sim Battery  Li-ion 4100mAh & it is non removable battery Memory  Ram 1GB  Internal 16GB(comes with 12.3GB)  External 32GB Cam   Very good, but it doesn't have flash, & it includes with paronoma Sound  Excellent output speakers  Awesome sound in ear phones FINALLY I AM FULLY SATISFIED WITH MY HP SLATE 7 & i thanks to Hewlett Packard to releasing this item with excellent features"
124,06-Oct-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"Note - I am not writing a review about the product but about the pricing practice of these online retailers.  With such an advertisement for 6th Oct as biggest online sale on flipkart I see that the price of this product rose from Rs.12499 to well above Rs.14499. TO my amusement WS Retail is selling it at Rs,16999... This is just wow that these retailers still think Indian buyers are stupid.  Just my opinion based on my tracking of prices on Flipkart is that Flipkart does not remain trusted anymore for best price and have certainly been losing to competition. Hope they realize the same."
125,03-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"First of all, kudos to flipkart for the quick delivery (within 40 hours).  A brief review of the tablet (after almost a week's use): Pros: 1. Crystal-clear display with good colour saturation. 2. Smooth and infallible touch with no lag at all. 3. Sleek with a sturdy grip and feels comfortable in the hand. 4. Excellent build quality and textured back-cover. 5. Fairly respectable processor. 6. Chrome finishing on the sides. 7. Runs on stock android and helps keep the UI clutterfree. 8. Very accurate and responsive accelerometer, magnetometer, gyro sensor and light sensor. 9. Dual front-firing speakers with good sound clarity. 10. The internal memory is not partitioned due to which there is more than enough space for apps (>12 GB) and can be joined to an external sd card using third-party apps. Cons: 1. Processor is not suitable for very heavy gaming. 2. No flash, dim light photography is not so good. 3. Persistent on-screen android buttons always occupy some space. 4. Sound is clear but volume is not very high (but perfect with earphones). 5. Does not support OTG.  Overall: The tablet fulfils my requirements perfectly (reading, surfing, watching movies, playing light games ("
126,06-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,not even a month since i bought it and the battery doesn't even lasts 5 hours on a standby so what can i expect from it if i was using it extensively. i had to choose between HP slate 7 and Samsung tab3....i only wish i had gone for Tab3.
127,24-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Product: * Nice Look and Feel. * Slightly better than Asus Fonepad 7 on Technical terms/papers. * Phone capability when you need one (Dual Sim Dual Standby). * Great for listening FM Radio.  In-Box contents * In-Ear earphones with MIC (OK, quality) * Charger and Manual * Tablet   Product Delivery : Delivered 2 days prior to Estimated Delivery period. Thank you Flipkart!!"
128,28-Sep-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"I am facing issues with this Tab within a week after this purchase. Inside Photo album the ""Delete"" menu item (to delete a selected photo or group of photos) is not appearing. I have reached out to customer care and they have reinstalled the software again but after some day it is disappeared again. This is disgusting as I have to reinstall all the apps again after every reinstallation of this software. This is not at all expected from reputed company like HP!!!"
129,23-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"I am really disappointed with HP for developing such poor product at this high price of 14000. Very disappointing product from HP.   Flipkart always top notch on delivery of the product.  I wanted to gift this tab to my mom who likes to watch videos, read, surf and play light games. But this tab dont even serve that purpose.  IT IS SUPER LAGGY AND IT STUCKS WHILE SLIDING YOUR MENU ITEMS.   BROWSING ALSO FEELS LAGGY EVEN FOR LOW END WEBSITES.  DISPLAY IS WORST.   CANNOT PLAY VIDEOS AS WELL SMOOTLY EVEN ON YOUTUBE.  To summarise,  Pros: Good Looks  Cons: The Tablet itself  Hope this review helps everyone those willing to buy this tab.  Please, I need a replacement for this tab, I would like to go with Dell Venue 8.  I have requested to return this product."
130,16-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"Hp Voice Tab 7 Not at all happy with the product just 5 months old and the screen flickers display gone black, try to contact customer service they give a dozen numbers no one responds."
131,08-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"I bought this tab just a few weeks before. Hp being a reputed company, it's products also keeps a standard for usage. In slate 7 also, hp includes the similar finishing and clarity in standards. Its wifi and storage capacity is awesome. The display is much better. Video recording is also better. Also, videos of HQ 720p are being played in a much soothing manner. In short, I really love this tab."
132,29-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,This tab is just awesome....Excellent working...Good RAM support...processor is fine!! Overall very good performance...And must to mention excellent touch...Screen resolution is pretty fine to watch HD!! Here i'll list some advantages and disadvantages-: Pros- 1.Good Touch 2.Very fine processor refinement 3.Easily supports any connectivity 4.Good screen 5.Does not bores you 6.good voice 7.Excellent RAM support 8.Can easily handle heavy workouts 9. Superb battery life  Cons- 1.Very little Lag 2.Gets heat up on 2-3 hrs of consistent charging  3.Gets Lag on heavy games 4.Average camera 5.Can easily slip from your hand or it's case...Due to its Slippery back  6.Drains out battery easily on 3G Overall mind blowing Tab and surely a must to buy...
133,15-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"The HP Slate 7 Voice Tab's price is highly fluctuating over few weeks, I got it at 11990/-  Well, the tab is fantastic.the touch is superb, other features are good, only the network and signal is bit down & the screen resolution is bit disappointing. Even increasing the brightness level to the highest level, it still looks dim beside Samsung Galaxy Tab 2, which is being used by my wife. Overall experience is good. The music player is too good and the headphones are better than samsung, iphone and even other reputed brands like Philips.   So keep an eye on the fluctuating price and book at the lowest possible price. Always try to by from the Seller ""W S Retail"" their delivery and service is the best in the Flipkart."
134,29-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"I bought this tab from flipkart last month. Delivery of the package is excellent as usual. But a good and prompt delivery never make us to ignore about the product qualities that fail to meet our need. I found everything I need for a tablet in it and rated 5 star except one as explained below. SIM1 (slot one) supports both 3G and 2G. But network reception is pathetic. In the tablet settings you will not find an option to use only 3G network (like WCDMA only). So the tablet will automatically choose either 2G or 3G according to the signal strength in you area. While there is an option to select and use only 2G, you cannot set it to use only 3G network. This makes internet connection speed or downloading/uploading a hell. If you are looking a tablet for the primary purpose of browsing internet and if you are not from an area where 3G networks strength/signal is strong, don't buy this product. But if you don't bother about this,in its class it is a the best in the rest."
135,16-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,strictly NOT for gamers.....better buy dell venue 8.........it issss quite slow..........goood for movie watchers and music lovers..............................asphalt8 never starts.....
136,13-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Overall specifications were better than Samsung Tab3 which was selling at about the same price. Fast Flipkart delivery.  Fast Quad core Marvell processor, no lag. Comparable to Qualcomm processors.   Good battery life. Runs without charging battery for around 2 days with playing videos, camera (photo and video), WiFi (mostly youtube) and some chrome browsing.  Excellent Wifi connection. Fast and stable even in remote corners of house. My Samsung S duos 2 wifi sucks compared to this tablet.  Camera quality is not upto the mark (photos in low light). But video quality is decent in sufficient light. LED flash would have added lot more value.   Crisp display. Sound is good due to front firing speakers.   Opening back panel was difficult (was scared that it may break while opening). Two sim card slots. One normal sim, other micro sim. Battery is not removable. But I dont want to remove battery. I hope HP will support if battery is to be removed/replaced.  Overall I am quite happy with the purchase."
137,26-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"good - gps signal, wifi connection, bluetooth, sensors feautures, dual sim, no heating issues,16gb inbuilt memory above average- cpu, display, battery backup, stereo speakers, FM radio below average-1 gb ram is too less atleast 1.5gb ram could have been better,camera  bad- gpu,various minor hardware problems mentioned in the reviews (i was also had one hardware problem and flipkart replaced the device) OTG not supported,no HDMI output,no flash light. cant make 3g video calls  am not a expert in tech. i shared my own experience with this tab.am using this for 1 month and i like this tab for hard gamers think twice and for browsing, for communication, for social network users,for movie watchers may like this. if you buying this device i recommend them to completely check with some apps from playstore"
138,02-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,Looks pretty good but not the same with performance. Just believing on the brand name I bought this tab but really not satisfied with the performance as well as the display. I feel it's not worth the money you pay. Even subway surf doesn't run smoothly. It freezes while having multiple apps run at a time. If you want to play games and watch videos then this might be the wrong choice. Battery backup is really good.
139,30-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"I purchased this device from another vendor. It is an absolute delight. The display is razor sharp. Battery is amazing and lasts a day with medium usage. The only thing that I found somewhat below par is its camera. The camera is average. Also, the device supports two sim at a time (One micro sim with 3G data + one mini sim with 2G data)."
140,28-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"I recently took the delivery of the HP Slate 7 Voice tablet.... (Snow White is what i bought). The finish is really good and I liked the grill finish on side which gives the handset a superb feel and look. The touch is very responsive and the processor is doing a very good job without any lag or delay.U cn buy it at a much lesser price from Snapdeal...around fifteen hundred less. The speakers are clear, but could have been better and the battery lasts for a full day with decent usage of voice calls.  Overall for the price I paid, i am happy to have a very good product unlike other brands which are not as great as what HP has launched."
141,18-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"Hi, I would like to tell u that this tablet doesn't come with UMTS 2100. That means u cant make the 3G video calls through it. However, u can do video chat through SKYPE etc. Hope this will solve many buyers dilemma about the 3G video calls through this HP slate 7 voice Tablet.   Aditya"

The speakers are loud and clear and the battery lasts for a full day with decent usage of voice calls and 3g/Wifi connectivity is also very good. There wasnt any disruption in connection of either of these modes. Overall for the price I paid, i am happy to have a very good product unlike other brands which are not as great as what HP has launched."
143,05-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,On the outside this may seem like a great Tablet but it really is a bad one.I used this for 1 month and problems began to arise.The loudspeakers become silent and Display become Dim.The battery power is not what you really expect.
144,12-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,Please do not buy this product... Touch sensitive not good.Battery backup Ok.. Heating is also a problem in this product.. Better go for Samsung or Apple. But this is the only one product with cellular option with minimal price.. Better avoid to buy
145,21-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,first i think samsung tab 3 best then understand that it is not best buy for that money........ now get the tab......i searching..............that is.........HP Slate 7 Voice Tab. it is best buy for this money..........and having better features than tab 3.. again i saying that this tab better than samsung tab 3.........
146,13-Oct-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,I have purchased HP Slate 7 Voice Tab but it seems that there is some deffect in the product. It got heated while charging and automatically the charging discontinue.
147,02-Oct-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"Purchased this product Cash on Delivery, till delivery everything was fine.  The TAB has micro sim slots had hence had to get the such a sim.  THe problem is that every now and then the TAB gives NO Service despite you being in FULL coverage.  You reboot the tab and then it works fine. have to do this exercise at least 10~1 5 times a day. Battery Back up is worst.  I had connected to flipcart to replace the product immediately in one week after noticing this problem. For reasons best know to Flipcart they rejected the replacement/ refund. Very disappointed with the service."
148,28-Sep-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"PROS: Battery : Good - lasts 2 days under moderate usage (doc reading, internet, voice calls, sms) Display Clarity : Good. Voice calls : No Issues. Works Perfectly. (Both Sims) Memory : 16 GB Internal Audio : Good CONS: Camera : Both the cameras lack clarity (not at all suitable for taking photos/videos but ok for videocall, skype) Gaming : faced little lagging few times while playing subway surfers!!! Software : Stock android so you cant move apps to SD card, i have to limit the number of apps that i use, otherwise device responds slowly (Tried with some 3rd party software also but i can't move apps). No USB-OTG!!! (I knew it before buying)  Others: Till date HP didn't relese or give notification for Kitkat(4.4) upgrade. It'll be good if they do so."
149,19-Sep-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,A competitively priced product from HP that offers 2 sim card holders (Mini Micro) Sim Slots. I didn't repent in buying this product. Battery life is good enough.   Back panel could be improved upon - so that it would give a rich feel to the user.  on the front side - the display used inside could be even better (Nothing specific to complain on the existing one) but if i compare with some recent roll outs in the market. i feel it could be improved.  Definitely - need to improve upon the RAM. for regular users - not to worry with this 1GB that it offers.
150,10-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Seems like a great product, service from Flipcart is top notch. The revised MRP is well known on the manufacturer's site, since over a week. Why discount a product on old MRP, this is not expected of a company like Flipcart and a seller like WS retail. My respect for you is shaken. Please look into this and rectify."
151,15-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,It's been one month since I'be bought this seven inches tablet from flipkart and the experience has been really nice. Let me list out the pros and cons of this tablet Pros 1) Lag free experience 2) Battery life is really good and we get around 10 hours on battery 3) Price is a plus point. 4) Dual sim feature 5) Loud speakers 6) Gaming without any visible lag(even high end games) 7) Average camera 8) Not too heavy  9) R.A.M is sufficient ( there is 1 GB of ram) Con's  1) Could be a bit thinner 2) We might not be able to update to KitKat.  Other options 1) Asus fonepad 7(2013) 2) Nexus 7 - 2013(no calling facility)
152,08-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Have been using this tab for 2 weeks now, and havent faced any problems. Just that it doesnt support USB OTG. but other than that the performance is awesome. No lag problems, Camera front and back is super clear as expected from a 5mp cam. I just hope HP releases its accessories pretty soon."
153,07-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Too big to handle ( actually its not so big as 10 tabs, hp is highly sleek and light weight, first thing I checked when I got this tab is whether it fits my pocket, it fits easily!!)  it Will look Odd for calling purpose ( will look unique and different, I believe its going to be a new style)  That its made of cheap quality material ( Not at all, superb quality with chrome border)  Finally Its a multipurpose device (phone+tab+laptop) if you attach keyboard.  Only drawback is tab accessories like flip cover, key board etc which is not available easily online"
154,28-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,Its a smartly designed tablet i have ever seen between so many other options available in market. No other tab can beat it in terms of specification. It has everything we need in a tablet. Good job HP. As compared to Samsung Tab or Nexus 7 in terms of price and features.
155,24-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Advantages: Display, Design, Resolution, Features, Front camera is good for video chatting (better than other tabs), Dual sim, and above all the battery life is great.  A great value for money product. Go for it..."
156,01-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,I placed my order from the seller WS Retail for this tab on March 29th and I received the product well packed yesterday. I was super impressed by the time taken for delivery.   The Tablet came in a sealed HP box. I am using it since yesterday and i am quite happy with it. The only thing i noticed is the tab heats up easily. Nothing major though.. May be because i am excited and using it non-stop. Will update after a few weeks of usage.   The product is shipped through ekart logistics and their chennai office DON'T HAVE A CONTACT NUMBER. Their national call centre number do not work either.
157,30-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,Wow.. I am happy with my purchase. This TAB is better than samsung TAB3. Best value for money and you cant get better feature in this price. And all above this- BRAND-HP :-) Pros: Good battery life Very handy Quality speakers Great touchscreen  Cons: Only problem -Could have provided a folding cover. Accessories are not available anywhere online :-(
158,24-Mar-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"Not very good phone but good tablet to use. as usual easily drooping signal but other feature as a tablet is ok.  look wise good , performance wise not up to mark."
159,20-Mar-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"bought the device from flipkart about 4 months back. The service from flipkart was awesome. had a problem with the display after using it for 2 weeks and flipkart replaced the device. *cool :)  pros -good battery backup -stylish (i mean, i really loved the front speakers) -light weight  cons -below average display -aweful camera -touch and scroll not that smooth - ok-ok performance.. no wow! element -very very difficult to remove the back cover(inorder to install the sim and memory card u need to remove the back cover) and the cover feels too fragile"
160,18-Mar-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,Very bad experience in having this product for a week. At first I was delivered a difective product whose mic was not working. Then I replaced with the new one whose screen was not displayed properly. Finally I have returned the product and get the refund. Though the service of the flipkart was very good in deliverying the product and replacement or picking up for the same for final refund.
161,08-Mar-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"I ordered HP Tab Slate 7 on March 5th 2015 and I received this item on March 7th 2015.   the product I received is very good, for its performance I rate 5. However I little dissatisfy with the services provided by Flipkart, for example, I did not get any rush delivery option while ordering.   I checked on the box, the seller is sent this product from Delhi, however it take more than 48 hours, even I understand the item delivery date was March 9th 2015. but I need this item delivered to me by same. Overall good experience. Thank You"
162,23-Feb-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"The Product since its purchase crating problems. The service center was also not able to do much. The product was purchased because of the brand but I'm much disappointed and never suggest any one to buy this product. I thought that after my so much complaints the service center or the manufacturer should take initiatives to resolve he problem but every time they wasted my time by upgrading the software, they dont know the actual problem. I much disappointed."
163,18-Feb-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,very nice tablet with amazing features and top build quality at this price range..completely satisfied with this product..thanq flipkart!!!
164,16-Feb-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"No complaints till now... Just one of the speakers got water logged.. so sound is not coming properly from one of them.   Dere is no use of talking specs as we all know wat dey are giving... coming to the pros adn cons;  1. the camera is good , in good light and moderate in the dark; gives grains  2. the front cam is not 2 mp in quality, but yess it gives you decent pics... 3. 4g not dere 4. for me it came with a raw android... i dont know why they dont customise it; but i upgraded it to the hps customised kitkat and its working fine  as u can see the cons ,.. no major upset is there. all dese are small issues.  rest all are pros. the camera does its job as is expected from it. The interface is good and the touch is smooth. HD movies run flawlesly and its a delight to watch pirates of the carrbn in full HD in the 7 inch screen. till today i never formatted my phone and still no hangs yet. although i keep running apps all the time . comparable to any good samsung tablet. Battery is also good. lasts 2 days on an avg usage.  for gamers, the slate never lets you down, as i play fifa 14 /15 without any lags evr.  so overall as per performance its the best within this price range. comes with inbuilt google chrome and hp box... its good as a phone evn. smoothly u can make calls. now; i have been a heavyuser as i dont have a phon. this works as my phone also .  So my verdict :: dont listen to evryone who speaks.. i am a hardcore user of it for 11 months and still unable to find a bettr performer in tablets. blindly u can go for it."
165,07-Feb-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"I am writing this review after using this tablet for 5 months. battery backup is not high class for continuous 3G usage, charging time too is moderately long, but other than that it is quite a user friendly tab. games and other operations are lag free. and the best thing is the net browsing. the performance in this regard is just AWESOME. I am glued to the Airtel 3G service 24/7, and the browsing is superfast... with very little heat. the 1GB Ram does the job quite well. Although the Asus fonepad 7 for just 8k looks very inviting, this one too has served my purpose and then some. looks very good... go for it !!!!!"
166,05-Feb-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"when i bought it i got it with jelly bean ,may of them said that that would be the last update,but hp has given an kikat update which is awesome..cool"
167,05-Feb-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"I bought this product in Oct 2014 and have been using it ever since. The build seems good nuf and so are the looks. But the UI and processing seems a bit sluggish and laggy.   The two front speakers enhance the movie experience.   HP also released firmware and OS update very recently so pretty satisfied with that.  You have dual sim slots and the voice quality seems just fine without much distortions.  Rear cam is a pretty decent 5 mp snapper with touch and autofocus, Secondary cam has 2mp resolution . Its not great but just ok for video calls. Very grainy though.  The delivery from flipkart was prompt and packaging was good as always. Full marks on that."
168,03-Feb-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"I have used for 10days before i wrote this review, as many users mentioned in their previous reviews this is not to be used as a primary phone because of its size and weight. Camera is poor (both front & rear). Speed is not so good (it hangs up occasionally & reboots frequently). Having said that, i find this as one of the best Tabs within this price range."
169,02-Feb-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,its just a osm tab..!! go for it...........!! I m using since last 5-6 months and its best tab in best price.........!!
170,28-Jan-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"> First of all thanks to flipkart for its customer service, unlike other online retailers (where price differ only by Rs. 10-20 but Extremely disappointed Service)   Advantages:  > KitKat Upgrade Available > Scratch-free Display (not Gorilla Glass but Rough Handling doesnt do much damage even Scratch) > Good camera (Certainly not the best)  Disadvantages :  > Battery Backup is comparatively less > No Drivers available (after upgrade to 4.4.2) > In build apps  > dents at outer cover and side (if rough handled bt didnt break)  Overall, Best Tablet for Budget Price, I recommend HP"
171,17-Jan-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"Touch sensitivity could be better All the other features are good video calling is a breeze Important thing is you will get stock android,  no lagging"
172,16-Jan-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,it is a very good product by a word fame company its working error free working from the purchased date in one line its amazing.
173,15-Jan-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"I purchased HP Slate 7 voice tab from Flipkart and I got HP 7 voice tab instead, from Flipkart. Returned the product (as they did not have HP Slate 7 voice tab in stock to replace it !!) after discussions with multiple support executives."
174,14-Jan-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"I bought this tablet for the brand ""HP"" but it turned to be yet another mediocre Chinese tablet. Build quality is not that great. I got a defective tablet initially though it was replaced for another new tab, I had to wait for 1 week for new one.   After 1 month of usage here is my review,   Performance, Battery life, Touch Sensitivity are OK.  Build quality is below average, Cover is a MUST.  If given another chance, I will not buy this tab again nor recommend it to friends."
175,10-Jan-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,i bought this product & use it from year and above.it's full hd screen is most nice feature and many other android feature is same like other android devices.battery capacity is also very good in this category & price range.only in built battery can cause a few problem during any hang the devices & restart time.internal memory is enough but in case of need of more memory u can add 32gb expandable memory.
176,09-Jan-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,This tablet does not support mobile data. Tried with multiple SIM cards from different service providers. Good for just playing games using wifi or offline; if that is what someone is looking for; go for it. Otherwise strictly avoid.
177,07-Jan-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,I've been using this for the past 7 months.  Pros: Battery backup Cons: lags even when mid range games and videos are attempted to operate. voice call clarity no kitkat update till date.
178,07-Jan-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"Good phone to go with a tab intergrated or vice versa.... Issues with the hardware like 1. It will show network but when you call from other phone it will be saying switched off. 2. Battery backup is good as for a tab. 3. Issues with the h/w like start hanging as you use more apps that uses web access to work eg: facebook, whatsapp, gmail, etc..... 4. takes loong time to charge battery...."
179,05-Jan-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"A good Budget tablet for 12K bucks. No Glitches as of now. Sound is good, both on phone and Music. Battery lasts a good one day. Though camera is not so good."
180,03-Jan-2015,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,Everything was good in the Tablet except the primary camera. pros: 1. good battery backup 2. best touch 3. nice front camera 4. stylish look 5. nice memory backup and quite fast tab 6. good for gaming 7. nice screen resolution cons: primary camera is like 2.0MP type
181,31-Dec-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"I bought it for Rs 15980. In next two week its price reduced to 12999. I called Flipkart for returning it for new reduced price. They refused it. So unlucky.  Touch is not smooth, its very poor. Graphics need to be worked on seriously. It hangs rarely. processor is good. some SIM card does not work."
182,30-Dec-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"I've been using this product for almost a year, and I had bought it from flipkart only. No complaints regarding Flikart's service, but this what I have to say regarding the product:  Pros:  1. The processor is really good. 2. The sound quality is fair enough 3. The back of the tablet looks really good and the feel is awesome! 4. The stock android experience is really cool  Cons: 1. The resolution of the display is below average. 2. The picture quality of both he camera is really bad. The primary camera which claims to be a 5 mp , merely gives result as a 3.2 mp camera. 3. The ram lags regularly, and gaming experience is really bad. 4. No OTG support. 5. And the BIGGEST shock, no updates for the android OS, its only what you get when you buy, that's it!!  Conclusion:  Please, Do not buy this product,and I repeat Do Not Buy THIS Product!!! There are lot of good varieties offered at the same range. So please check for an alternative if you care for your money..."
183,30-Dec-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"I've ordered this product from Flipkart and it got delivered to me in about 3 days(Hell yeah, they're totally AWESOME) and it's been five months since i'm using this tab and it's pretty cool. I totally love it. :)"
184,29-Dec-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"There is lot of issues in this tab-  1) If i am using WiFi or data plan in tab, then if at the same time i want to call someone then it is showing no contacts in the phone book, even when i turn off the WiFi or data usage still it takes minimum 1 hour to display the phone book, sometime it takes whole day to show the contact info. Even the tab restart is also not working in this case.  2) When i am using the USB cable as a charger then the tab touch stop responding or responds in incorrect manner.  3) Lot of problems with charger , sometime it stops charging the tab.  4) Very less service center. You can not get the answers for your problems in the tab.  5) Whenever i am inserting the micro SIM with the another SIM in the tab. It automatically restarts again and again."
185,27-Dec-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"I have been using this product for over four months now. and so far haven't found any thing to complain about. Flipkart's delivery is awesome.The product was completely intact, safe and sealed."
186,19-Dec-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,viewers please don't buy this HP slate voicetab. i bought this tab 9 months ago via flipkart and already its motherboard is damaged and needs replacement. it's voice output is so low and even with ear phones clarity is not that much battery doesn't last for more than 3 hours no system for personalised settings it's not worth buying and dont go after seeing deepika padukone' add on tv i think these actors should personally use the products before recommending or better say stop misguiding people even the HP centers service is so poor I am really disappointed with HP people and their poor quality products. it's better to go for samsung
187,17-Dec-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,Great Product at affordable price. Only thing is you need to change habit of handling bigger phone. You can easily suplement with Bluetooh and Speaker phone.
188,10-Dec-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,2,"I purchased this tablet in May 2014 in India and later shifted to Indonesia, due to lack of accessories for it had to buy a local cover for it. By chance it fell down and instantly the Glass got broken. The service center in Indonesia offered to repair it at 80% of the current market value. The grey market had no spare parts available for this whereas for Samsung and Apple products market is flooded with all range of spares. Even on checking the service center in India, found that many cases of broken Glass reported for it. HP shall have to offer the parts at economical prices to make the products successful for long run."
189,07-Dec-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"My first purchase from Flipkart and very happy!  After researching on a tab for my parents, I decided to go for HP Slate 7 voice tab and I'm happy with the choice. Hopefully, that happiness will sustain.  My observations after the first use: 1. Easy to use, the UI is easy to use and adapt to. 2. Its economical and gives a decent config for the price. 3. The build quality is good with a smooth finish, probably the reason why its a bit heavy? But feels good in hand. 4. Performance is fine considering my requirements are just for a good browsing experience, Youtube, emails, news, etc among other basic activities. 5. The speakers are clear and I liked it, it cant be deemed low sounding as I read in a few earlier reviews since it also depends on the music/sound bit rate. The HD videos i watched on youtube sounded nice and load. 6. Played Subway surfer and there was a bit of a lag though."
190,06-Dec-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,No major issue for last three months. Had accidental fall once but no damage except mark on corner. Battery last only for the day with nominal use. Had to replace charger once under warranty the guys at service center were helpful.
191,06-Dec-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,It is working perfectly Fine. Much better than samsung tablet. Even Flipkart delivery is Good. All the features provided are excellent within the given range. Faster processing as well as dual sim tablet make it an outstanding tablet.
192,03-Dec-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,Very good. Display is good. Battery is good. Speakers are good. Good one for watching movies. Good one for studying any PDF.  Would recommend others to buy it.

197,15-Nov-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,I purchased my slate on the 29th of September 2014... I received the product on the 30th as I had applied for a 1 day delivery... The product worked well for about 30 days and after a few days it stopped charging.... I am unable to use my phone now and flipkart now wont even help me... I am very disappointed with the product and flipkart.

199,13-Nov-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,2,i have purchased this product recently. the rear camera is disappointing. Hp could have put 8mp camera in place of 5mp. The pictures are too grainy. net connection is very slow.  display screen is very good.

202,09-Nov-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,this is really an excellent product.. bit higher in price..but quality matters.... recommended for buying if one decided to buy a 7 inch android tablet...
203,08-Nov-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"The product is good, and it's been a month I'm using it. There are some exceptions in Android OS(as u know sometime rarely tab hangs,) but product is of HP and it is quite good. Just not satisfied with the Flipkart's delivery timing, for this product I've waited 8 days, and got it after making few calls to their Customer Care... But ok... satisfied with product quality."
204,07-Nov-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,over all good but photos clarity is not good even it is 5 MP camera. Some time it will hange while playing games.

Build is awesome. 4. Light weighted. 5. HD videos looks awesome. 6. Front firing speakers are good. 7. WiFi is good. 8. 3G is great. Used Tata Docomo 3G which was awesome (prev i used Sony Experia where 3G was bad).  Cons :- 1. Headphones are not good. Had to buy sennheiser which is highly compatible with this device. 2. Immovable battery. 3. Doesnt come preloaded with many important apps. 4. Only 1 sim is of 3g which is the micro sim.  If you want to go for a good tablet at an affordable price then go for it.It's the best one available at this range and you can trust HP,it wont disappoint you....."
208,19-Oct-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"I bought it in April, 14 as gift to my wife. I cost me 17000 rs and its original flip cover cost was 2500 in addition. The touch is sometimes not smooth and now there is reduction in its price much ( a disappointment for me buying at so high price), overall good one. Flip cover was big flop considering its price."
209,18-Oct-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"Screen, RAM, Processor, Display, GPS was good. Battery life was decent. Great finish.  But one issue, 3G SIM slot is the micro SIM slot and the other one is normal. i noticed it after purchase."
210,16-Oct-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Pros: (1) Very good looking front & back panel (2) Silver plus Metallic lining adds gravity in the look (3) Provided with extremely attractive specifications (one of these features is the internal memory of 16GB !!) in this awesome price (just compare with others like 'samsung', 'lenovo', 'dell' etc) (4) 'HP Connected', 'HP ePrint', 'HP File Manager' (comes pre-loaded) are really of good use (5) Nice sleek get-up gives you very good hold of it for doing things (6) Mini-SIM for 2G and micro-SIM for 3G  Cons: (1) No LED flashlight (2) Although two speakers (under top & bottom silver   lining/casing), sound quality is not upto mark (really low)"
211,15-Oct-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,Disappointed with the response.  Get a Samsung tab or ipad mini.  I hope it upgrades to Android 4.4.4 and there is some improvement in the response time.
212,12-Oct-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,first of all thanks to flipkart for delivery before expected date . tablet is good in every aspect and also reliable ( hp product) but camera quality is not worth a rat's ass anyways build quality is good

218,06-Oct-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,I used this tab and found it is worth of money. Flipkart offered the good option in the price range of 12k to 15k. Specially it is dual SIM based which makes it differ than others product in market.  i'd recommend others as well also to GO for it !!!!!!
219,05-Oct-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"Overall product is good, like  * 2 sim support (2G+3G)  * 7 inch display * average battery (approx 12 hour on average use)  but i faced following issues * charging stops after some time, have to check again and again whether it is charging or not. (Took it to HP centre, he gave reset and told that 99% tab issues have been solved like this. But it didn't helped. Again took it to service centre but this time he said that they will change mother board if he see that charging has stopped. And it charged for 2hour that day..... after that i never took it back to centre.) * Becomes hot"
220,05-Oct-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,Volume on one side of the earphones is really slow which ideally should not be the case. Too big to handle and heats up really fast.

239,15-Sep-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,good product but the price at flipkart fluctuates for this product very frequently and the price provided in flipkart is not the price provided in HP official website for the same product. In the HP website without any discount the price listed in 14990 INR

245,09-Sep-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"Hi Flipkart,  ur always 100% upto the mark with ur delivery time but it really hurts the customer when he/she gets a faulty product. kindly replace it ASAP."
246,08-Sep-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"I bought it from a local stores recently. What was displayed in Flipkart comparison with other varities was incorrect. It was indicated to have LED Flash - which is not there. I don't know how products are advertised with wrong specifications.  Camera - very good in daylight and for landscape photography. SIM - One slot is for a mini-SIM which is not mentioned in advertisement. Battery - non-detachable. Battery depletes fast if you are working on internet.  Processor is fast and reliable.  Other performances are good, though the speaker volume could have been better. Considering all aspects this should have been priced below 10k because one can go for Intex Smartphones instead of this with almost all similar and even better features"
247,07-Sep-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"I am writing this review after 1 month of usage. First of all I would like to say that I bought this tablet for gaming and it is performing really well . The display quality is excellent and internet speed is really fast . 16 gb of internal memory is not divided for games , apps , media and things like that u can use the internal memory without any partition , there is no limited space for games , apps and media u can install games and apps until the internal ,memory gets full . You can extend the storage via micro sd card upto 32 gb but still u cannot move apps , games and media to micro sd card . I have installed games upto 1.2 gb but still the internal storage is sufficient for me . The battery has really good standby time .So thus I am trying to say dat without reading these reviews go ahead and buy this product ."
248,06-Sep-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,i wll prefer everyone to buy this tablet because this tablet is super fast & touch response i like butter so...go for it
249,06-Sep-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"After four month of product use i observed some white patches on screen, i raised this to HP service centre; But they are not sure about the service of the HP regarding the fault. i.e weather to replace flagship or any underwarranty repairs. Even i did'nt offrred repaire for the same. Now it has been two months theres no reply from HP service.  Game Reivew: 1. Subway surfer lags alot 2. Basic parking game not working 3. Hill climbing lags. 4. Dont think of high end game with this 5. This tab sucks  My final sugestion 2 all Dont buy this tab. It will drainb your juice."
250,02-Sep-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"This is a nice tablet, screen resolution is excellent, But, the processing speed should be high, and the operating system should be upgraded to WINDOWS 8. Sound quality is manageable, also the battery performance. Overall to say, It is very nice tab, without any hesitation, one should go for it."
251,02-Sep-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,Overall experience of the product uptil now is good. Just a month use. Speed n all ok. Battery strenght can be better as well as camera resolution. Otherwise all good feature wise. Just will like to tell HP to hav its own cover case.
252,01-Sep-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"After hands-on to this particular product, I felt awesome... The built Qualtiy is too qood and in this range I got all the features what everyone want in Tablet.  Cons: The only problem is that after installing heavy/ lot of application device turns slow. The responsiveness is also slow, but manageable."
253,31-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,2,The processor does not support subway surfers and truck simulator 3d .the camera does not support for 5 megapixel.music sound was bad.not good quality tab.don't go for it.
254,29-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"Really disappointed with the Flipkart service this time. Even after 14 days of giving order, have not received the HP slate 7 voice tab from Flipkart, Tracking no. mentioned by Flipkart does not show the current consignment status. As per the call centre of the concerned courier company, this tracking no. does not exist. Even called call centre of Flipkart. They are also unable to give any information on the delivery status of the consignment. I get only one response - that is to wait for the consignment for a few more days. But, no one seems to make any real effort to track the shipment and work for speedy delivery. Planning to cancel the order. The rating I gave is not for the product but for the Flipkart service."

Hurry hurry.. buy ..it.. a brand from HP that you can trust blindly.. Thanks.."
259,25-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"I think for the price its quite good. The only issue what I think is that the power input to the device from its charger is 5.3V 2amp. If you are thinking about using this device with a portable charger, do make sure that the output from the charger is 5.3V and not 5V. it really dosent matter if the amp's differ (would only affect the charging time)."
260,23-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"This product is not as per specification that Flipkart is showing,making fool to the customer, just beware while shopping from flipkart.Never buy from flipkart it sucks like anything. Better to buy from retail shop there atleast if some thing goes wrong u can directly catch the person but here only frustration you will get daily customer care calling and n number of explainations and end result is waste of time and your money gets trapped for 20 to 30 days. choice is yours!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

264,21-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Here is my overall Feedback on the shopping experience and the product.  1. The ease of shopping on the flipkart website is simply great. Why ? This is the only website where the filter options work amazing. It lets you choose the best product according to your budget and needs. I went to multiple websites to check the offers but flipkart was the place where I felt comfortable making the decision to order the product. Also would like to comment on WSRetail. This is my suggestion to all, especially if you are planning to buy a mobile or a tablet, go for products from WSRetail. There customer service is amazing. I received the product in just 3 days time.  2. Now about the product, the tablet is good. You can go for it if your budget is less than 15K. If your budget is more than that, then there are many other good options.  3. Touch screen is very good (4/5), 16 GB internal memory (5/5), WIFI and Bluetooth work amazing (5/5), Dual SIM (5/5), Primary Camera (4/5), Secondary Camera (3/5), HD Video Recording (5/5), Battery life does depend on usage, but it is good (4/5).  Thank you. Hope my feedback will be useful."
265,20-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"HP Slate 7 Voice Tab It is best at this price. Poor camera quality, but other features are good. Front firing speakers are nice. Way better than Lenovo and Dell in this price range."
266,20-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"The product is awesome, though it took time for me to get accustomed to it. The quad-core processor and 1 GB of RAM, provides seamless browsing, gaming. The 7 inch rich display is awesome. Camera is quite good. Done smooth voice calling without call drop . Battery life is good as compared to other tablets.Audio through headset is decent. The tab is very sleek. Plays HD videos without any kind of lag. It has both 2G/3G support, but I was confused at the first go, then i confirmed SIM2 is only for 2G, SIM1 is for both 3G/2G. I had seen a review about 3G connection, they need to check the sim slot they are using and check with the network provider."
267,19-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,1)The item I ordered had promised that there is a LED flash In primary camera.But the product delievered to me doesnt has the same. 2)The ear phone supplied with the product doesnt has volume in right ear piece. 3)Flipkart has promised that the product would be delivered shortly byt it was delevered after 10 days.
268,16-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"First of all, i got tab delivered in 3 days of ordering, 3 days including 15th aug holiday(so 2 days)  About Tab voice7  Superb Built Quality. Its Screen is crisp clear.Has 2 front speakers which deliver considerably good sound. A bit louder than phones.  Initially i thought there is prob in touch screen, but it was just the screen gaurd( has to be changed. Really pathetic screen guard)  Pros: 1) Built Quality 2) Screen Quality 3) Sound 4) Calling capability with dual sim support(Sim 1 is micro & Sim2 is mimi) 5) Average cameras (5+2)mp 6) Has 2A charger & headsets in box  Cons:  1) No Android version update available yet. 2) Lock & Volume rocker keys are unusually at left side making them uncomfortable to use.  I have used it for just a day or two. After a month's use il post full review."

273,06-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,After using this device from last 45 days I am writing this review.  Pros:  1:Nice look 2:Graphics is good. 3:Good sound 4: Memory is enough for medium level user.  Overall good for average phone user.  Cons:  1: Case is not available in market. You will have to purchage adjustable case. 2: Battery issue. This issue is found in all smart phones. 3: Little bit issue with internet. 4: Sometime found issue with using internet with sim 2. Need to boot after setting.
274,05-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,this tab is good enough for a medium level users. sound is a bit low comparatively..that's the only main disadvantage i felt using this tab...  rest all features seems to be good enough to satisfy the expectations...
275,04-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,.A 1.2GHz quad-core processor with 1GB RAM powers the Slate 7 Voicetab and it seems fast enough to run Android 4.2 Jelly Bean smoothly. Apps open quickly and there was no obvious lag when scrolling through homepages or menus...camera is fine nt impressive......
276,02-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"HP Slate 7 Voice Tab is the best tablet you can buy in this price. I got that on Flipkart. Excellent delivery way before its given date.

So be careful and compare prices on all Online shopping Websites............"
278,28-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"In one word ""decent""....got all necessary features that could have been provided at this price...only problem...the sound of the front firing speakers could have been a bit louder.I would recommend it."
279,28-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Got the product very quick, amazing battery life, better than Samsung products, was easy to connect to my Bluetooth headset, envious design, excellent back cover"
280,28-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Worth to buy..n in flipkart,price is very low. Light weight and very handy. Quality of making was good. Awesome music play with headset. Battery backup is very good. Has a dashing premium finish/Easy to hold and make calls. Decent Display & has good viewing angles. Front-firing speakers."
281,27-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,one of the best product I bought frm FlipKart  Worth buying. Quad core processor doesnt slow the device. HD display for movies.. ek dum jabardast.
282,26-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"Received this item today with one day delivery guarantee services. I have been using HP products for last 12 years but this item was my first purchase. Though I don't like Samsung products, so I was looking different brand. After 6 months continuous review observing I bought this item but the product is below my expectation. I purchased this item for internet usage on the go but I'm using internet for last 2 hours and found its speed is very slow. Looks is attractive, installed feature is also okay but sound is very poor. I called a friend using this device but the voice was not clear."
283,25-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"Before time delivery by flipkart, thank you. Every time have to press the side button for unlocking.. A bit annoying. With flash the camera would have been more useful in low light since in low light image are very indistinctive.. Otherwise OK product by HP. Hard to find perfect sized cover. And 1 big complain... Cannot download free books from play store since no promo code was provided by HP nor flipkart."
284,24-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"A nice voice tab to buy. A good product from HP at the reasonable price, as compared to samsung tab neo, Lenovo A3000, and others. Cons-  No flash for camera"
285,23-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,I have buyed it a few days ago...Initially their was some problem may be that was because of some virus or any thing ...but after i installed antivirus...its perfectly working fine...  I am happy with the product and the over all feature provided by HP in this cost.  Good User Experience.  Will recommend other to got for it :)
286,22-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,Best Tab and giving good competition to other tabs and i prefer to buy this tab. Better in comparison to Samsung and HCL tab..
287,20-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"well, it is a tablet which does everything what a tablet can, I am satisfied with it, but what embarrassing is that its not good for calling at all, although two sim feature with one micro and one normal is quite helpful for net using. There are two speakers which works quite average. IT'S EARPHONE IS PATHETIC, Looks are OK and processors are horrible, although it is a useful tab for those who wants to watch a movie at workplace and listen song with another headphone."
288,20-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,HP slate 7 is a great phablet based on android 4.2.2. This tab does not support otg directly but if you download otg support software from play store then it will support USB pen drive . There is sufficient hardware for HP slate 7 voice tab .there is all type sensors are placed . so one thing I can say that it is an excellent product within this budget. All modern facilities are present in this HP slate 7 voice tab.
289,16-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,I order the tab in april I have got these tab in 4 days 2 months I have tested it is good tab I have played asphalt 8 real racing 3 vice city san anndress gt racing 2 etc
290,14-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,I ordered the item and it was in transit for ever. In between I could lay my hands on the product at reliance digital.The display though HD does not have the vividness that samsung tab4 t231 offers. Also came across many reviews complaining of network issue.The white back did not appeal me looks wise as well.  Hence decided against it and cancelled the order.
291,13-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,2,its battery backup and camera not good and battery backup is not working more then 6 7 hours on net and call.
292,12-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"It has got everything's good except processor. Its performance is terrible and one cannot play heavy games without any lag. Infact i noticed a lag for HD videos that made me really upset. I downloaded antutu and checked its score.  On antutu benchmark , its score was 12100 which is below average for a tablet.  FYI - Antutu score for Moto g is approx 17000, Dell Venue 8 is approx 22000, Dell Venue 7 is 19000, Digiflip tablet is approx 15000, Google Nexus 7 2013 is approx 20000  So if you are looking for a performance, this is not the one. Request you to research over internet before concluding anything."
293,05-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"it is a very nice calling tablet like a mini tv in your pocket .there are many clasic and good specification in this tablet.it is not tablet it is phablet.wow owsma design, looks, spekare ,camera, voice quilety ,slim slots,multi tasking..."
294,04-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"I always insist on a quality product and this HP Voice Tab Slate 7 is not a disappointment. Its got good finish. Great features with A 4.2.2 and sufficient hardware support for that.  ONE Great thing about this is its super easy UI, right from the start set up to the guide which can make it easy for 8yr olds to 70yrs grands alike. Thats a plus from HP.   The box contains additions like headset which I was not expecting as part of standard box.  The main contention of 7 inch Tabs out there (esp with HP products like laptops) seems to be the battery life. But with a 7 inch IPS this seems to be universal and best way to save on that battery drain is to disable background data, avoid and switch to airplane mode when not in use and screen brightness. Unfortunately the tab doesnt update to kitkat from 4.2.2. Thats the Big big drawback.  I'm impressed with the Flipkart service that delivered it before the deadline with a day to spare."
295,03-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,It is a good product and worth the money's buy. the item is working fine. the delivery was at a great speed and very neatly packed for the safety of a sensitive / delicate device. India has a last mile problem and flipkart has resolved this. A good bridge will be built but the debris will be lying on either ends for years together.
296,02-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"stylish look, nice battery back up, smooth nice no lag, comfort with hands every thing super"
297,02-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"as a tablet very good, i even got 10 % discount for my credit card. as mobile quiet difficult to hand because of size."
298,01-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,I bought this slate7 on one week back. And i share my experience what i observed with in this week. I think it will helpful to the other who interested to buy this tablet.  Pros: Performance was good.  Excellent resolution.  Most suitable to watch movies and playing games.   Cons: Camera is not upto the mark.  Heating problem( if you play games for long time).
299,30-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"Good deal with flipkart apart from this product is good not excellent, good looking tab in this budget"
300,29-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,As I have got the product in a Good deal! It's worth the price for the config. Yes obviously Rear camera without the flash is not that beneficial. But again it worth the price and its awesome look 'n' feel!
301,29-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"Good tablet. little pricey considering the fact that similar configurations of other brands available with lesser price. Call voice quality not the best. However, it is a good tablet, with sleek design and providing all that is required by me. It satisfied me with overall performance as per my need. One may have this tab in its belongings. GOOD Tab from HP."
302,25-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"The good: A very decent product at this price range - good look and feel. A premium feel of the product is what I like about the tab. Speakers are nice too.  Not so good: Screen is average - nothing special, I feel."
303,19-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"But product not deliver on time,plus no applique for delay in delivery. Hope they will work on it soon"
304,17-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"A very quick and safe delivery by Flipkart like always. Overall the HP Tab is very good and surely it's a value for money.  Pros:- 1. Battery backup is very good. 2. Very good finishing. 3. Dual Sim. (GSM GSM) 4. Good choice for storing a moderate amount of media. 5. High-resolution display. 6. GPS- able to capture signal very fast. 7. Audio is pretty good.  Cons:- 1. Charge time 6-8 hrs. just restart this shit and 10% of battery is drained out.  2. HP Case/ cover is not easily available in market. 3. Back cover quality is also poor 4. Camera quality is not up to the mark (photos in low light).  5. Heating is also a problem in this product. 6. Does not support OTG. 7. This tab have only 950 MB RAM , not 1 GB"
305,16-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"Its really good in delivering right product, also customer care listen your problem. Going good. keep it up."
306,12-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,A good product for the price! No complaints on the tab but some minor points 1. Has 2 sim slots. The 3G one is a microsim slot. so the options become limited. 2. it is available only in white and so smudges are easily visible.  overall agood buy.
307,01-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Hp slate 7 is better than cheap Samsung tabs  Good finishing and design is very nice, with good calling both 2g and 3g, good gaming experience, full HD video, 16b gb, quad core ... what else....   JUst go for it"

309,28-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"This is all in one package, dual sim, 2G,3G, 2 cameras, large screen, etc. Couldn't ask for more This tablet is worth an investment. Only con is its very delicate, so you need to buy thick case for it."
310,26-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,Please don't buy this tab if you are thinking you can connect your existing data card 3G/2G because this tab does not support OTG connection you can not connect your pen drive from this tab.  There are many tabs with low cost from HCL and many other companies so go for it because they all support these features and have much better battery from this!   I am regretting after buying this tab on the wrong info. given by flipkart.
311,26-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"No flip Cover. Issue with display. Touch screen is not good, touch does not work in few places of the screen."

316,22-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,Nice feature and specification..!! specially 3G wireless connectivity and price was really affordable RS : 14199.
317,21-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,This tab is perfect and according to my expectation. I can't imagine that hp can give such a great tab which leaves all the laptops and tablets far away. It's a great tab and I personally recommend it to everyone. Also I am going to purchase two more for my brothers.
318,20-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,2,"tab was not upto the expectations, returned it due to charging problems. i noticed lags even during scrolling through the apps. not able to play a single game smoothly. processor may be 1.2 ghz quadcore but it is ancient for today's world.  speaker is not good at high volumes.  i now opted for dell venue 7 3g tab, very very datisfied with the dell venue tab its just awesome."
319,17-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"Awesomr product from HP..... Hp is better known for laptops . But this time its a tablet .i.e. Hp slate 7 voice tab.

Quad core processor  2. android 4.2.2 jelly bean that is sufficient.. 3. Internal storage 16 Gb which is already huge 4.

325,05-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,A very quick and safe delivery by Flipkart like always. Overall the HP Tab is very good and surely its a value for money.   Pros:- 1.

326,04-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,This is a great product. I would say it is a must buy Voice Tab. Over all experience with flipkart and this purchase is great.
327,02-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"My experience using the tablet has been great. The touch can become a problem once in a while needing an additional touch or few such. I haven't had any dissappointments in trying to use it as mostly as an e-book reader and a navigational guide and sparingly as a multimedia device. Inability to share files via Bluetooth from the preloaded HP file manager app would have been one, if play did not throw a free and more comprehensive alternative (x-plore).  Sometimes I wish the apps launched quicker and I switch faster between them. But that is not a dampener, especially after the device survived an accidental fall in the first week of my use like a charm and not a scratch!!  To sum up, I like my ware for the limited uses for which I employ it. And it does well when I tread beyond my staple for it."
328,28-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"its a great piece with the price, only thing no case cover is available in the market also in with HP. please tell if any one find that suits 7 voice tab."

332,25-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,3,"in this price band, its more than anything comparable  but got himself   super-cons like the camera,inaccessibility of basic phone functions  good thing is built,front cam,response,battery ... enough for any student"
333,21-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,The tab is pretty good for the price.... but i seem to have a problem with the network connection...it's quite low
334,18-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Pros : Good deaign, slim,lightweight,good processor, no interminnent hanging, low price,clear sound with headphone, good baterray life  Cons :  vedio resolution is little bit low, does not differ if you compare with the product in same price band"
335,13-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"Terrific value for money, excellent battery life and touch sensitivity. speaker volume is a drawback. HP carry case needs to be a standard accessory."
336,12-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,I purchased this product on April 1st and i am facing charging issues. When i put charger it is not charging but the battery alone is heating very high.
337,08-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"NOTE: I did not purchase this product from flipkart. But purchased from HP eshop. Build quality is very good. Normal battery life as is the case with every android device. At this price tag and configuration, this is awesome device and that too from BIG brand HP. Touch is really smooth. Made for multitasking as it comes up with 1.2 GHz Quad Core Processor. I would rather use rear camera than front one.   Drawback: Average camera capability with 5MP cam at front, since it's without LED. Hard to find case/covers and screen guards for this. I am still struggling in local shop and will compromise on local covers now."
338,08-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"Good Display , best Graphics, Nice look, Rich video quality, Camera upto best. Best thing in 17000. Please go for this with your closed eyes."

341,05-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"Great Tab...Value for Money, Delivery is excellent, it's delivered before the expected date. Camera Quality is poor( but can't expect best quality in Tab of 5 + 2 MP on Rs. 16K) Sound Quality is good compared with any other Tab in same range of money.  Nice Product...am happy with this and quick delivery."
342,04-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"At the instant I received this tablet, all friends got crazy by it's looks Really premium look performance is also nice, sound quality of speakers is amazing and headphones - ultimate quality also appreciable display Camera is Just Ok, Noisy even in normal light.Front camera is also slow.  except camera this tablet is bang for the buck. giving 4 stars just because of camera otherwise it would worth 7 stars"
343,02-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,"HP slate 7 is worth buying at this cost (under 16k). I really enjoy this product and would definitely suggest this product to all known to me. Its simply excellent, to say. Flipkart did a fantastic job in delivering the product on time"
344,31-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,1,"Today I had a live demo of this HP Slate 7, but this product is very bad if you want to use against the sunlight. Brightness is very low. Looks like a night mode in full Brightness.  So, for someone who cares about eyes this is the best otherwise dont go for this.  Finally, I didn't expect this kind of product from HP"
345,30-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,1) Does it support external pen drive?  2) can we transfer apps from tablet to SD Card? 3) Does it support 3g video call? Plz tell me
346,29-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,4,"It is an awesome tablet but the question is how much storage is available after installing many apps and games. If this tablet supports installing or transferring apps to SD cardthen it will be a complete product. If someone has bought it please add it in their review. Else specs are completely awesome and Galaxy Tab 3 & inch or Neo sucks in comparison to this one,"
347,27-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,HP Brand is trust worthy. I bought HP Slate 6 recently. It works awesome. My kid and wife also like it very much. I am using it multi purpose.
348,25-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,It is really good for the price it comes in. Too many things supported. Works fine. Good display. Plays HDMI videos too. Good and clear music and phone call voice
349,14-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Voice Tab,5,buy it...its worthable....good battery ....nyc features but its big .....instead of that nw anytime i will prefer this
350,21-Feb-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,5,"Been using this tablet for almost a year now ( I had it imported from US)  Its super fast with a 1.6 GHz processor and touch sensitivity is really smooth  Camera is pretty decent and for a dual camera its a really great buy  Additionally it comes with Beats audio and output is really awesome on a good headphone !  Kickass tablet if u wanna watch movies on the go Just install a vlc media player app from play store, load all ur movies and watch videos/movies on the go..( plays almost any format)  At this price its really awesome !!"
351,07-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,4,"First let me tell you the accessories you will be getting out of box . The tab itself and the micro USB charger with US Pin. No data cable , earphone is available. You can use any other micro usb charger to charge this tab. Or you have to buy some converter/spiker to use the charger that comes within the box.  The pros about the Tab, it has very good display when you compare it to other tabs in this price range. you will get 5.8 gb of internal storage and it does support micro sd card. I have found the normal tasks, net surfing very smooth, no lag at all. And the normal games run very fine in this tab. Didn't run heavy games on this, I use iPad Mini for that.   Now cons, the speaker volume is very low, the usb and bluetooth connections are of older versions, hence the are very much slow. The main camera quality is not that great(though they are providing front facing camera at this price range which I feel is great)  Now the verdict, Obviously I didnt expect it to perform like ipad and all, But it fulfilled all my expectations except the speaker volume, for which I am deducting one star :)  I would not suggest it for heavy users, this is more apt for our parents or students. I bought this for my mother and she is quite happy with it ..."
352,29-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,1,"For 6000 price it is ok, it has all basic features, but resolution not godd, some grns are thr, battery is weak, for this price adjustable, camera not gud but for tis price it is gud, also cpming with U.S type powercords :P Most funny thing is they are selling this low cost tab to 13000 ROFL"
353,30-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,5,"I bought the HP Slate 7 Tablet for INR 7000/- a couple of weeks ago! The tab has everything loaded in for that price tag - i couldn't ask for more! Android means every app that ipad/nexus can have will be available on this tab.  The touch is good - may not be as fine as ipad/samsung but at that price fineness cannot be expected.  Simple to average games play like a breeze - I haven't tried heavy gaming as I'm not much into gaming.  Net browsing, e-book reading is smooth - no freezing screens etc.   Rear camera - 3MP - good and handy for my needs Front camera - 0.3MP - for skype video calls - just ok.  8GB space - I had 6.2 GB free space when I unpacked - I still have 3.5 GB space and with the option to extend to 32GB, that'll be a lot more than my needs.  Suggestion to flipkart/WS retail: It'd be good if you can provide a combo offer with case cover - because it's a little difficult to find the right case for this tablet.  Overall, a superb tab with an affordable price tag! Happy!  Flipkart/WS retail: You just earned a loyal customer. Great job from competitive pricing to delivery!"
354,21-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,1,Hp Slate 7 Charging adapater Flipkart supply with Eruopean standard type pin and it is not made for our country use.We need to purchase separate connecter to charge the tab.  In the website specified 30days Return policy but practically is not working with Flipkart.Only in words.When you click you Return back the item icon and after oneday they will call us and simply say this is what company standard supply and it is specified by other users.But others all specified in the website after my purchase on 30th March.  I suggest only Flipkart for Covers and they are not acting fast like when we order the item.
355,10-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,5,"Box includes: Tablet / USB cable (for data and charging) / Wall-power socket with 3 US type pins (so you need either a converter/adapter to connect to wall sockets) / manuals. No headphone or SD card included.  Very good response and performs tasks with ease. It's a very premium finish with metal bezel - which is surprising at this price range! It has two cameras - front and back. Fixed focus and okay for daily use, however not for high-end picture use. Battery life is excellent - gives 6 to 7 hrs on normal use (browsing, music, etc.) Definitely a very good bargain considering its from HP and not just any local low quality companies. Go for it while stock lasts!"
356,05-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,5,in 7K this is the best tablet with brand name features but with every increase of 3000rs in your range you will better and better tablet so first check your range then but no problem in playing 1080 hd videos and no problem in playing games likes iron man 3 high end games......it has beats audio output not bests speaker so don't get confuse....very low output in inbuilt speaker but great output in headphone so my suggestion is but JBL tempo and you will get rocking sound battery take 3-4 hours for charging and will last fro 7-8 for normal continuous use 2A output charger no headphones or earphones in the pack no file explorer so you will have to download the same from app store( not a big deal my advice ES file explorer) no micro usb but you have micro sd slot so no need for it you can't transfer app from internal memory to external sd....so internal memory is near to 5.5 gb good camera in good light only but if you are looking for camera don't go it go for a digital camera because this is a tablet not a camera android 4.1.1 no update and don't hope for future also touch much better than samsung tab3
357,14-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,1,"Anyone going for this tablet...don't for following reasons  1. Have worked with dual cored but the one on this is slow. 2. I thought 3500 Mha battery would last long, considering I bought it to read only ebooks etc but to my surprise batter goes down from 100% to 20% when left on standby for 15hrs...have seen this behavior at least 7/9 times till now. 3. Display is not that great either. 4. Beats Audio logo on back is place holder...nothing great abt it"
358,08-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,5,Its a wonderful tablet must buy the best thing in this tablet is games.Games like asphault 8 and real racing 3 are superb.This tablet is fast enough.when u will buy this tablet u must have beats headphones because the clarity of the headphones are exellent because its sponsered by beats.The camera is only 3 mp but is nice.u can click a panaroma photo also the front camera is like ipad's front camera.
359,29-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,5,"This is a value for money. Performance is not as per samsung galaxy tab with almost same confirguration but a good one if someone wants to wath movies, listens to music and surfing casual net."
360,12-Mar-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,5,"How come people buy cheap china mobile with 1gb ram for 13-25K and say this is not good tablet.  Pros: 1)Intel clover trail CPU (u have search deep in play store to fina an uncompatible app) 2)2GB RAM , great for multitasking, no mobile out there below 20K with 2GB RAM,  3)good design 4) good display 5)Noise cancellation with two mics 6)compass sensor along with Accelerometer, gyro, proximity 7)you can play all games with it  Cons: 1) 3MP cam on back, it is good cam, but you cant ask for more for 9K (some websites mentioned that pics are covered with blue color, that is bcz they dont know how to remove camera filter) 2) 0.3 in the front, i think instead of placing 3MP in the back, they should have place 2MP in the front. Bcz people use front cam more often than back one.   But video calls are okay, not bad and not great.  ITS THE BEST BANG FOR BUCK IN INDIA, Even comparing with moto G"
361,03-Jan-2015,HP Slate 7 Tabl,2,The product was bought as a gift to my daughter. It turned out to be quite bad. The Pin that connects the charger just broke!

364,21-Aug-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,5,it's a best tablet in this range(below 10000) with a strong core processor...............the only bad thing in this tab is that it doesn't support OTG.....rest are good

367,28-Jul-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,1,Wasn't this product placed around 7k few weeks back? How come it rose to 13k suddenly? And all the reviews (even recent ones) also put the product at 7k...what kind of sorcery is this?

371,10-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,1,Not fruitfull for use for Internet. Option for access intenet is third class. I will sugges to all my friends not to purchase this product in future.
372,08-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,1,"Purchased the HP Slate 7 from flipkart, I am experiencing the battery issue. Its getting discharged in 45 minutes, and the charging pin is not properly working.  But If I see the product reviews its excellent, may be my piece had the issue."
373,02-Jun-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,2,"Looks like HP wants to win this cheap gadget race. In the desperation, HP made such a useless product which stopped working in just 20 days. I bought this tab on 6th May 014 and on 26th May 014, it suddenly stopped working ! Thanks to Flipkart, just today only I received my refund. Interestingly product looks good, runs well but it will stop working suddenly, so buy it on your own risk !!"
374,27-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,3,"I am writing this review after using this tablet for more than 2 months..  Pros :-  Good sound quality and volume (beats audio) Design  Cons:-  Touch was not great but mediocore Lag will be very high when we play higher end games, you can feel even if you play temple run.. Battery will be draining very fast you can get maximum of 6hrs and charging time for full charge is more than 2hrs Os is very old you cant get any new os updates Ofcourse you should not expect great camera experience for this range ( No flash ) Conclusion :- Its not a great table for this price range but i wont disappoint you much, NOT recommended for gamers..."
375,26-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,2,"I have been using this tablet for over a month now. It is heavier than Nexus 2012, hangs pretty often, wi-fi connection is poor, and battery life is pathetic. Even with minimal usage, it doesn't last a day. Now I know why HP is struggling with its hardware business.   I understand that Karbons and Lavas of the world, selling at the same price point, deliver much better value for money. I would advise avoiding buying this tablet."
376,25-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,1,"Pls dont waste your money on purchase this piece of gadget. One of the very low standard product, started hanging and switching off permanently - my usage has been very limited and surprised it happened. I checked all product user reports on Hp site and this was a constant problem being reported worldwide due to hardware issues. Surprised HP is not bothered nor Flipkart. Flipkart informed they cannot replace the product and asked me to visit the service center. Thumbs down for Flipkart, bad experience with you guys- didnt expect you to make the regular customers go around haggling with your customer support executives."
377,15-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,3,The tablet does not start up unless you have wifi and register it...till then it is impossible to start the tablet after purchase. I had to out to a mall with wifi to be able to put it on the first time...this is a headache. Only after this onetime registering thru wifi only can you start using this tablet.
378,13-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,5,THE BEST TAB IN THIS PRICE  ALL THE FEATURES ARE VERY GOOD THE BACK CAMERA IS THE BEST AT A MP RESOLUTION
379,12-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,4,I wanted a tab for my 6 years old kid but at the same time was no willing to spend more than 10000/- as I know it will go through rough use. Got a good deal from Flipkart and bought this one for 7000/- ******************************************************************* Video quality is good but lacks in sound quality. So far basic games are working fine. Build quality and finishing looks good.  So far satisfied with the product.  ******************************************************************* Even after upgrade the OS remained 4.1.1. I hope HP gives an option to upgrade it to 4.2.1 or 4.2.2 soon.
380,07-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,3,"This is a basic entry level tab. You will get only 5.6 GB free space to install new apps and free memory space only 525 MB. 3MP camera is not good, just ok."
381,02-May-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,4,Good product from a reliable company.  Smooth touch function and handy device.  Good battery life and good to play apps and games

383,30-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,4,as i said it is so nice to use but the only dificulty that i seen is it take about 4 hrs of charging
384,29-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,4,"After 2 days of usage, things I noted  Pros:  Decent performance, good touch response, good display, popular games work without lags  Cons: You will need wifi to start the product for the first time.  There is some problem with google play services which consumes high bandwidth (unrelated to hp or tablet i believe).  After the first time,It wont detect wifi networks. Even specifying SSID wont help. Later I discovered that there is some software trouble with wifi driver. U need to change the wifi channel of your router between 0-9 for this product to work. Works fine afterwards  Charger is not indian standard, No headphones  Cannot restart (power off and then on)  Automatically turns off while (charging + not using)"
385,28-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,4,"Its really worth for the price which they mentioned. Good performance as of now but, RAM size is showing around 324 MB free out of 628 MB RAM which is Weird. Otherwise the product is fine with no issues.   Cons: - No flash"
386,28-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,4,"The discounted price makes it a very attractive proposition. Purchased for my son whose HCL Me U2 (a piece of junk) gave up the ghost roughly after 9 months of purchase. It is a vast improvement over the U2.  The build quality especially is top-notch, reminds me of the classic Motorola Xoom, which was built like a tank.  The color saturation and contrast ratio look fine, and viewing angles are more than decent.  Only complaint is speakers seem a little underpowered."
387,28-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,4,"Processor> Menus, apps, and widgets zoom and slide around smoothly while navigating the interface, but things do stutter a bit now and then. Small apps like Angry Birds Rio take only a few seconds to load, but it can take larger games such as N.O.V.A. 3 an exceedingly long time to start a level.  GPU> The Slate 7's Mali-400MP4 quad-core GPU, delivers good gaming performance for a 7-inch tablet. Judging from its 3DMark score, the hardware seems to have some skill at rendering post-processing effects such as particles and high dynamic range, but fails to match the Nexus 7 at raw polygon pushing power.  The real problem however is the lack of a gyroscope, which makes playing games like Riptide GP -- which can be controlled by tilting the screen -- more than a bit problematic. The main character lags behind my tilts, making it unplayable with this control scheme. Thankfully, there are alternative control schemes for the games, but none work as well as tilting. That is, when tilting works correctly.  Camera> Actually, it's doubtful good cameras are even possible, so it's no surprise that the Slate 7's front and rear cameras record washed-out images and video. The front VGA camera also drops plenty of frames while recording. If you're only looking for ""a"" camera on your tablet, HP gives you two. Neither is very good, but they get the job done in the most superficial way possible.  Graphics> I played a 720p MKV-encoded movie on both the Slate 7 and Nexus 7 through the Dice Player. The video was obviously sharper on the Nexus thanks to its higher resolution, but what was really troubling was the stuttering playback on the Slate. During fast action or simply when the camera panned around too quickly, the Slate would slow down or drop frames noticeably. The same video played smoothly on the Nexus 7.  Sound> The Slate 7's speakers belted out typically tinny tablet sound and even with the Beats Audio turned on, delivered only slightly less tininess while being a bit muffled. However, when listening to bass-heavy music through headphones or earbuds, sounds was noticeably improved with Beat Audio activated, giving extra thump and clarity to the low-frequency sound.  Battery> HP claims about five hours of video playback, which is low but seems about right from what I've experienced. Its battery life dropped about 20 percent after only an hour of playing a 720p video.   Conclusion> Good for a newbie but not recommended for gamers but among low budget tabs within 9999 it's the best buy I bet."
388,27-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,4,"I am going to give this tablet 4 stars as this is one of the few good tablets available in this price point (Rs 6k-7k). The reason I deduct 1 star is for 2 reasons: 1) The speaker volume, even though it claims to be Beats audio, is very low 2) The WiFi shows low connectivity sometimes even when you are very close to the router. Although it does not effect the speed that much.  Other the above 2 mentioned issues, I find that this tablet is very aptly priced. Also the brand recognition gives some peace of mind."
389,24-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,4,"I wanted a budget tablet for gaming purpose for my kid. I wanted to go for Micromax Funbook., but settled for a few thousands more with HP Slate 7. The delivery & service from Flipkart was upto the mark. About the product, the overall feel is good. Pros : Battery life : good. Loading of many apps : no hangs. performance : smooth., no complains n the feel that you have a branded product.  Cons : Beats Audio : expected better sound., feels the same as any other tablet. nothing special. Display : I wish I had opted for a HD display., it makes a huge difference in overall feel of the display screen.  I would certainly recommend this phone., as it is surely value for money. ( i got it for 7K from flipkart ) But at the same time would suggest to go for a phone with a better display."
390,22-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,4,"Got this tablet after considering many options and my expected usage. I am pretty much satisfied with the capabilities of the tab. Can play HD videos without lag, Relatively less heavy games-temple run, candy crush are a breeze. The tab seems a bit heavy to hold but that's no cause for complain as the feeling is more of a solid build than a bulky monolith.  Weeks usage. Verdict-- Got what I paid for which makes me very satisfied."
391,22-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,4,"Although slate 7 is devoid of certain good fetures like sim ,3g still i like it, coz every available feature is working properly.it's been 1 month with no complaint till now. video is running properly,games support,battery backup, every thing is nice....  flip card people are nice too I got my tab within 3 days...."
392,21-Apr-2014,HP Slate 7 Tabl,4,Item has been delivered one time. Flip kart doing amazing job. Item delivered before the targeted date/time. This one is good . But the only problem is screen display is not perfect in day time. Nights times resolution is superb.
