1,19-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"Hello all, I am using this laptop from last 2 year (that time it came with Windows 7). Its really a great laptop with amazing performance. I use it for extensive coding and designing work using advanced softwares and it performs really well.   Dont listen to people who say that AMD processors are bad. Really they are people who are not updated after 2004. AMD have done great job in their A8 and A10 Processors. You can purchase these laptops blindly as they are cheap, and have good performance. Moreover they are offered by HP.  Note : i didnt purchased it from Flipkart, and i regret when i saw it at cheap prices on flipkart then that time market rate :("
2,20-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"Just for a preface, i ordered this laptop when the price was 24990, later it got reduced to 23490, for which i had to cancel the previous order and re-book at new price... Price went further down to 22,500, thats when i brought it. Kudos to flipkart for making the shopping experience so comfortable and customer friendly. Its a cool laptop without almost everything required in a system for a professional Laptop User. Cannot be deemed fit for gaming as AMD has this issue of giving RAW power at the expense of battery and heat. But otherwise it a GREAT system for everyday computing. It remained cool for the entire time i used(around 6-7 hours) to dual boot it with Ubuntu 14.04 and update the software. No heat ups at all. The body is very very light and sleek... Fell in love with the design(having owned a Dell Inspiron 15R). As mentioned in previous posts, everything is pre-installed in Windows 8.1. Worth every paisa spent on it...  One sentence advice - Go For It(Its not available on any other store at time i am writing this.)"
3,04-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I have owned many Laptops previously but this is the best value for money Laptop I have ever purchased in this price range so far.   To start with, it will definitely catch your eye with its really attractive & stylish looks. This Laptop is fully loaded with some very nice features that will serve all your purposes be it personal or business or entertainment related.   It has a 4 GB RAM which is expandable to 8 GB with 500 GB Hard Disk capacity in which you can store all the data that you can ever Imagine.   It also comes with a Window 8.1 Operating System which is wonderful.   I have been using this Laptop and I must say I am very impressed with its performance. The Battery life is damn good even when I watch movies or play games on it. And last but not the least It has a very good sound quality which makes my movie watching a delight.   Over all if you are looking for a laptop in this price range, this is the definitely one of the best you can get. Totally Recommend it!"
4,21-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,3,"HI..ALL, i purchased it on last month 18th-Oct-14 & i received it on 21st-Oct-14. Till now now its working with medium performance even after i installed multiple operating systems have been installed such as windows server 2k8 & windows 7 (VMWARE).  But  It has 4Gb of RAM with 800MHz speed, there is no chance to expandable it due to motherboard supports only 4Gb. while checking the specifications in flipkart shown as RAM can be expandable upto 8Gb.  After i consulted with HP support team they said :""motherboard supports only 4Gb of RAM.Except this fake specification everything is fine. Any how i like it."
5,04-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"HP has launched a clear winner in this segment. I think this is the cheapest windows laptop from HP that too with A8 processor which has 2ghz speed. If you are looking for a laptop which you can use for browsing, watching movies, playing games or even multiprocessing, this is the best laptop. It's a great laptop even if you are looking to gift your parents because of its price and speed. I didn't expect AMD processor to be so good; It's definitely better than i3 laptops"
6,22-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"Beautiful slick design is the key for this laptop. AMD APU quad core A8 processor and 4 GB RAM is a unbelievable deal at this price range. Performance is as good as any Intel core i3 lappy. Preloaded windows 8.1 is joy to work with. RAM can be expandable upto 8 GB which is pretty cool. The laptop runs in a absolute noise free manner. About the cons, the build quality of the laptop is not that hardy. The display I found is a bit dull and PPI is less. So the text and images are not as crisp as they look in the the modern day hi resolution smart phones.  Overall, a absolute value for money laptop for daily use with moderate gaming performance."
7,09-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I got it for just Rs.16.790/- thanks to flipkart's big billion sale. At that point, it beats by a huge margin each and every other competitor :P overall a decent laptop with NO DEDICATED GRAPHICS but 512mb INTEGRATED Card. The processor is pretty good. Sound is average. Display is awesome. Viewing Angles especially."
8,25-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I was looking for a decent laptop and had shortlisted 2 of HP laptops one with AMD A8 processor and other with intel 4th gen core i3. Finally i purchased this and am very happy i did so. I got this for Rs 21250 (22500 - 1250 credit card discount). First of all thanks to flipkart for a good price for a good product i.e a great deal and quick delivery. 4/5 for Flipkart since everything was great except the packaging which didn't meet my expectations for a product that is delicate and expensive, but that was balanced out by nice and delicate handling by the flipkart logistics i guess.  The Windows Experience Index is 4.7 CPU - 6.9 RAM - 5.9 Graphics - 4.8 Gaming - 4.7 Hard-Disk - 5.9  Now let me bust some myths related to AMD vs Intel in laptops. This laptop is as cool and silent as any core i3 laptop out there and overall performance seems better than a core i3 though i haven't compared side by side. Its very smooth and fast for a budget laptop. I used it for 4-5 hrs continuously and with heavy multi tasking (CPU running above 2 ghz) while charging for about an hour, and the laptop was placed on thick cloth, and after all this the laptop was just marginally warm below the air vents. Seriously impressed.  First let me start with the complaints or cons 1) It does not have a VGA port. But one can always buy HDMI to VGA adapter from Flipkart itself. 2) The viewing angles of the display are poor. its disappointing and this could be a deal breaker for some. 3) The keyboard is a bit shaky and little noise in a small portion of the keyboard near the Enter, backspace and numpad keys, but thats pretty normal as per other laptop users.  Pros 1) Good performance (quad core cpu + 4gb ram ) 2) Windows 8.1 comes preinstalled.  3) and really nice audio quality through both the speakers and the headphones. But the placement of the speakers is a little odd. Speakers are placed on the front bezel slanting at 45 degree which means they will easily get blocked if the laptop is placed on a pillow on mattress. 4) It comes with a free HP branded backpack which is a of a good quality but can accommodate just 1 or 2 books alongside the laptop, its small. 5) It comes preinstalled with Mcafee Antivirus with 1 month subscription. 6) Battery recharges in 1.5-2 hrs and discharges in 3 to 4.5 hrs depending on what task you do, so good battery backup.  So far my user experience with this laptop has been awesome and very satisfying. The laptop is pretty fast and smooth in general usage but sometimes the Antivirus coupled with multiple tasks tends to be unresponsive for 5-10 secs every now and then, and I would blame the antivirus for this. I have not tried any games yet since there is a single partition and HP toll free guys said they don't support partitioning and I haven't created a recovery media as well, but looking at the performance I feel low to medium graphic intensive games should work without any problems like NFS underground or AOM, AOE, CS etc."
9,20-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"The review will be based on the Cons and Pros:  Pros: 1. Very Good processor at this price 2. The display is very good and has very low reflective screen. 3. Sound quality is good and should be kept on a flat surface to get better results. 4. No Heating issues after using 24hrs continuously. 5. Battery charges up pretty fast  6. Charger also doen't get heated up 7. Has DVD Drive which is added advantage. 8. Has separate Num Keypad  Cons: 1. NO VGA PORT!!, As per a sheet provided by HP (A sheet which has graphical representation of all the features available), It says this laptop has VGA port but actually it doesn't have 2. The keyboard keys feel as if they gonna break anytime 3. The up and down key are split into half (It doesn't have a separate Up and Down arrow keys like the left and Right arrow keys, They have cut down the size of it) 4. Battery lasts usually around 5~hrs 5. No Back lit keyboard! Really bad when operating at night 6. Comes with Windows 8.1!!! 7. Only one huge partition is available!! 8. No Recovery CD provided 9. The enter and right click button near the touch pad are Ok Ok 10. Viewing angles are Sort of Ok Ok 11. The key board has one major problem, Usually in laptop the function keys such as brightness control, Volume control are merged with Function keys such that one has to use Fn key + the combination of desired key. Here its different, Directly the user can control volume, brightness without using Fn key which actually is not GOOD"
10,23-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,1 -good graphic quality 2-great battery backup 3- pre installed everything 4-original window 8 5- nice look  6-works efficiently  7-great gaming experience 8-highly satisfied with this product . 9-sound quality ranges medium . 10-amazing flipkart services :)  !!
11,18-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,2,"Today it stopped working after 1.5 months of usage. Suddenly it hung a lot even if there was nothing consuming more CPU/RAM and next day it won't open at all. Planning to carry it to HP Service center.  But this is a good laptop otherwise, didn't have any issue while using it."
12,16-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"I got the laptop for 17k with exchange offer. It looks very good , touch pad is very good. It is hard to use the touchpad buttons though.  The screen resolution is 1300 x 768 . I have serious font problem with windows 8.1. Fonts look very bad not sure whether it is windows problem or the graphics problem.  Overall it is a very good deal if i can solve the font problem , but so far i tried various things they did not work."
13,15-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"It's an Awesome product at a decent price really satisfied with the product , the discount day on the Billionth day sale as I am one of those few people who are lucky"
14,17-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"I have observed that there is type in Detailed Description of ""HP 15-g049AU Notebook""  I saw the fallowing under OS description  ""The Dell Inspiron notebook runs on Windows 8.1 operating system. Experience the Windows operating system's smooth and versatile interface on this notebook.""  Can you change it."
15,08-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"I have purchased this on flipkart Big Billion Day sale, grabbed for 20,390/- . Well the surprise is, got it delivered by the next day afternoon, flipkart at it's best delivery. The packing was solid, got a branded hp bagpack free. Well Coming to the Product. Pros: Looks: The design is very simple, with pure black glossy finish. You can only find the processor branding below the keyboard. Speed: I can say its far better than the 4th gen i3 processors available. It's base frequncy is 2 ghz and can be clocked upto 2.4ghz in turbo mode Battery: I got an mixed usage of 3.5hrs on 75% brightness of the screen with 10% battery remaining. which is not at all bad at this price point. Gaming: Well i would suggest not to use it for latest games which require high end graphics, moderate gaming performance will be at its best. Speakers: Good, but not best. Screen: Viewing angles are fine with this price point. Operating System: Comes Preloaded with windows 8.1. This is the best advantage of this laptop which will attract most of the users  Cons: Keyboard: I felt the keys of keyboard to be very delicate comapred to others models. Mouse Keys: yeah, these are like solid rocks which you need to hit them hard.  This is a very good one for the beginners who are going for an moderate usage. The windows experience index scored 4.6 for this model.  When verified in Zauba the import price of this laptop is specified as 19,703/-, but still i got it at a good deal and my warranty is also there till november 15, 2015.  Guys who missed it on BigBillion day have to spend few more bucks to grab it."
16,18-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"Product is awesome and performance is also very good. However, Flipkart service I am very dissatisfied. Total disappointment. Despite of telling the urgency, they delivered it late and all of the customer care people keep saying different things. These type of issues I keep on experiencing with Flipkart, now it has become their habit.   TOTALLY PATHETIC SERVICE!!!! NOT HAPPY AT ALL"
17,17-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"Brought this laptop from flipkart.. as usual the product was delivered in excellent condition and before the delivery date indicated while buying...Have been using this laptop for about a week now. Looks great and Works great..Only the Touch pad Click keys are a bit delicate and make a sound when pressed. Have bought a mouse to avoid using them..As no restore DVD was made available with the laptop, had to make it at home..took 5 DVDs and almost 3 hours to do it...Wish they could have charged 100 bucks extra and supplied them with the laptop..The free laptop bag supplied with the item is of decent quality...Overall very satisfied with the product I got for the price I paid"
18,02-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"First i thank to flipkart for successfully delivering.  This is good laptop for many use like gaming,daily,movies,etc Before receiving this i was thinking that this not for me this for some office user but i was wrong i played many games in it like need for speed most wanted 2012, FIFA 14 etc.  I will say that this is awesome laptop for gamers also go for it."
19,26-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I am writing this review after 2 months of using this laptop. Performance wise the laptop is good u can play HD videos, games without any lags. For Developers it can be a decent config (runs Photoshop,Android SDK,etc) For casual user it fits best.   Pros: Great Configuration can be compare to i3 laptops. Runs almost all apps, games and HD videos smoothly. Battery life is good. Battery charges up fast. Build quality is descent. Windows 8 runs smooth. system heats up on heavy usage and also cools down quickly. laptop is doesn't seems bulky. Comes with some good installed software from HP.  Cons: people have experience touchpad freeze which seems to be caused do to hp multigesture driver.  PS:for people confuse over RAM slot in this laptop, It has single RAM slot which has 4GB RAM if you want to upgrade then needs to replace it with 8gb one."
20,25-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,the product is not so good as it has been presented in the reviews .i guide you guys to buy from the market rather than online.the product looks very cheap.quality.
21,22-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"this is the best laptop with multiple features under 25k. i ordered it on 19th and got it on 21st...wesomme delivery by flipkart and thanks to it, amd a8 is wrkng grt witout any lag....best laptop to use under budget."

23,05-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,I received the Laptop as scheduled.   Had some issue related to warranty redemption on HP site. Flipkart resolve the issue quickly.   I will update the performance related comments shortly. So far i am fine with my purchase.  No Heating is correct observation  Performance - To be tested
24,31-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"This is a nice laptop and absolutely great for the price range. Got it for 22080 after 2000/- off on stanchart credit card, received on 26th Dec 2014. A8 processor is good and fast. No heating at all. Sound is just ok without headphone. With headphone its good enough for any purpose. Display is great...can see HD content with great clarity. The Surface is of glossy plastic...I like it but not sure if everyone will. Keyboard is fine and responsive but the touch pad is not that good, sometimes it doesn't respond promptly. But mostly its okay. A separate mouse (USB or wireless) will be more useful. I have not started using it for development purposes, but soon I will. Will update this review if I notice any significant difference."
25,22-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,2,"We purchased this laptop on the Big Billion Day sale...worst mistake ever. was given a defective piece where the space bar key was malfunctioning from Day 1.   When we asked them to replace it, they said it cant be done and a mechanic would come and resolve the issue. Please understand we're working 6 day 100 hour weeks and no one has the time or patience to wait for a mechanic: a simple replacement is desired.   On top of it they closed the complaint 3 times saying complaint has been resolved, when actually the complain was NOT resolved at all.   Finally after many times back and forth (trust me it seemed like a tennis match at one point) the product was replaced ""as an exception"".   One more thing - cashback of Rs 2000/- was applicable on use of a Citibank Credit Card. However it is not an instant cashback, something which is buried in the fine print). Cashback is credited back to the card after minimum 4-5 months, as per their contract with the Bank. So pls keep this in mind while expecting a cashback.   Bottom line: Am happy they finally replaced the laptop, but please consider twice before buying laptops on these high traffic days!"
26,22-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"Overall nice product but why OS is not activated? Nice one day delivery. Most charming, I got a nice backpack from HP."
27,14-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,3,link - http://fkrt.it/RHKld9NN open this and get extra discount onn everything on flipkart.!! also get better deals and this product at half price on flipkart.!
28,06-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"This product was advertised for Rs. 23,590. I bought it for 9 months EMI (ICICI bank). Finally when the CC pymnt went through, the actual billed amount for the product was Rs. 24,490.  This has increased the monthly EMI from around 2,700 to more than 2,900.  Customer service is absolutely useless.... at least in this case!!!! This chasing them to get this resolved."
29,12-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"Purchased this laptop few days ago and I am very happy with its performance. The laminated black body really looks good and boot time is in few seconds. Good deal at very reasonable price!!! Only thing I am unhappy about is that when I purchased it, there was an offer of purchasing 2 years extended warranty for Rs 2499 but I never got anything from Flipkart and when I called HP they said that offer doesn't exist so bit disappointed."
30,07-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,Got My First Laptop from Flipkart but with the defect. It is really sad to know that Flipkart doesn't even bother to check items before their delivery to the customers.  As soon as I switched on Laptop I noticed one dead pixel on the screen. This is really embarrassing now returning back to Flipkart hope I will get replacement for it.
31,31-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,3,Getting this configuration at this price was a good deal. This is fully loaded piece. I got this one on exchange of my old laptop. The speed and use is smooth. But there is some issue in touch pad. Even my 6 yer old laptop touch pad was better and smoother.
32,31-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"Got this laptop delivered on Diwali day. Thanks to Flipkart for the prompt delivery. Am happy with performance of this device for past few days. Initially, I was skeptical about AMD processors, but after lot of research went for them. They are good and so is the device. Able to perform multitasking and operate multiple apps in parallel."
33,24-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,This is a good laptop which changed my opinions about amd processors. It is very good performance. A good laptop at budjet.
34,22-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"awesome delivery by flipkart received it in under 24 hrs. Laptop is light weight,soft keys win 8.1 rocks and easily upgradeable to any win update to be released in future. Processor is fab .laptop doesnt have heating problems maybe because its new xD no noise. Seemless processing!"
35,22-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,Good laptop for home use.  Pos: Looks good AMD processor 4GB RAM Win 8.1  Con:  Keypad plastic is cheap.
36,22-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"After using it for two days i am writing this reveiw, lets come to conclusion first .i.e you wont be dissappointed at all.  Hard Disk Available to end user is 462 GB and 3.6 GB RAM.  Pros: As most of them already aware of it, so i am skipping this part.  Con's: 1) Touch becomes bit lazy :) i meant doesnt respond for a sec or 2 at times. 2) Keys not bad, they could have given better i felt. 3) MS Office S/W not installed, was really shocked when i came to know that Office is missing :(.  Regarding Flipkar: No words to Describe in their efforts to get things delivered. Awesome guys and keep up the good work.  One request for all buyers, please avail the extended warranty and be tension free for next 3 years :)."
37,20-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"I ordered for HP 15-g049AU Notebook on 6th Oct 2014. The expected date for delivery was 18th of Oct. and as of now today 20th of Oct i didnt recived the product yet. I escalated the issue to the concerned department. At first they ask for two business days and then when i get no call from their end, i call them asking about it. I get an answer "" We are sorry ma'am..we regret the inconvenience. Give us three more business days."" After three days, no call from their end. I call back.. I am tired of this situation. This was not expected from a brand like #Flipkart. I am loosing all trust on #Flipkart. This is very frustrating and unacceptable. Order ID: OD300943623216401400"
38,18-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"no laptop below Rs 30,000 can match this laptop!! offers great value for money!! Best laptop in sub 28k category"
39,11-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,3,An affordable laptop with Good processor and sleek design.Build quality is good.  Integrated Graphics Card having dedicated 512mb.  Display is ok.  Having issue with frequent mouse pointer freeze.  Overall worth the price..
40,05-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,An A8 laptop at 25K and that too with preloaded windows is unbelievable! That too from a brand like HP makes the deal even sweeter....   I had purchased an A4 laptop at 25K 6 months back and I thought that was a killer deal. But HP has upped the game and come out with the A8 at the same price point!! Moreover its the A8-6410 which means they havent compromised on the processor as well..   I have recommended this to my friends who are waiting for a good deal to get a laptop! It just cant get better than this!!
41,04-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"AMD A8 machine at a very reasonable price of 25k. A performance laptop in 25-26k range, that's a catch. Since this laptop is only available on flipkart I hope a brief review would help.  Pros: -A8 machine at a very reasonable price -4Gb RAM(expandable to 8Gb),ensures decent performance  -Touchpad with multi-gesture support, pretty much changes the way you use laptop touchpad -Full-size keyboard  Cons: -It's not a gaming laptop, for better gaming experience one would probably need an external graphics card  Value for money, performance machine."
42,23-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,2,"After using this for a month, I am not overly satisfied with it performance. It is AMD A8 (Quad Core, boost upto 2.4 GHZ) and has 4GB RAM, but still cannot handle even the most basic of multitasking. If background virus scans are running, then you are done for! Screen freezes and response is slow. Open multiple windows, apps, etc and again the performance suffers.  I am and always have been an Intel fan. But I got influenced by reading reviews in this forum and others that the AMD A8 is even better than than Intel Core i3... So NOT TRUE !! Truly disappointed with AMD on my first purchase."
43,22-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,2,"The AMD HP machine is good product after a full week of working I can say that. It works just fine for every day needs. I use AutoCAD a lot on it and it is working alright. The volume of speakers a bit low but with the kind of pricing it is gr8 product. No heating issues till now.  Delivery was quick full marks to Flipkart.  However, please donot fall for the the Flipkart offer for Extended 2 years warranty and 2 years accidental protection. This product is not listed on HP's website (as explained by flipkart) for extended warranty and protection programme.  Flipkart should not be making false promises to the customers.  Next week I am planning to take up the issue with HP, in the meanwhile I have written to flipkart let us see if they come forward to resolve the issue. Keep you guys posted."
44,18-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,Great laptop but not for development purpose if you want to purchase it for development then don't purchase it
45,03-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,The produuct is good but it is not the best .... ram cannot be expandable but in flipkart it says it is expandable .... later will update abt the product after receiving it
46,22-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"When I purchased this laptop in the previous week, the specifications on the flipkart page showed that it had a 4GB 1600MHZ RAM. But the laptop only has a 4GB 800MHZ RAM.  Flipkart has later updated the specifications page after I have raised the complaint to show 800MHZ by replacing the 1600MHZ which was mentioned a few days ago.  Flipkart, you cant change the specifications after receiving the money from us. You are promising one thing and giving a different thing. This is not professional at all and just not acceptable from a reputed company.  I hope you will sort out the issue before a class-action suit is filed for misleading customers by providing false information. This incident can be sued for as per the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and also be reported to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission simultaneously."
47,19-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,Bought this laptop yesterday and its very nice to use. Boot time is faster than my 3rd gen i7 laptop. win 8.1 is really a boon. Battery gives upto 4 hrs after fully charged. Laptop is very light weight and very elegant to use. Keyboard comes with Num pad and the buttons are not so good but OK. Likewise hardware in this laptop is neither good nor bad. Its the best laptop for college students and AMD A8 is much more faster than PQC.
48,01-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"This Laptop keeps hanging in between and the error it throws is as follows   Your Pc ran into a problem and needs to restart.We,re just collecting some error info and then we,ll restart for you (System thread exception not handled)  I have contacted flipkart for return and they have arranged a call with HP technical team to resolve the issue . The HP representative told me update the BIOS version software with the link that was sent to my email id , I have installed the updated BIOS version software however still the problem persists .  The laptop shutdowns frequently which makes you feel annoying as you need to open all the application again after restarting and they are chances that your data may be lost"
49,03-Apr-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"Hi Guys am going to review this after using 12days..... Good budget laptop.. AMD Done well job. there is no heating problem..... Battery gives up to 5 to 6hrs for normal usage... Everything is fine... Multimedia applications like Adobe CS6 are running smoothly.... If u want to use Highly demanding applications like Maya, Unity,etc and Serious programming you must increase u r RAM size.... There is one problem with RAM. In Flipkart they mention RAM frequency is 1600Mhz but it is a 800Mhz RAM... Except RAM Everything is really good,... my sugestion is go for it.....Bcz low budget and good performance for medium users...."
50,03-Apr-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,Using this laptop since 4 months. Extremely good . Just a problem with the antivirus McAfee otherwise best product in best price.
51,31-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,hai Guys.. this is my first review after a lot of shopping from flipkart frist cheers for it faster delivey service  coming to this product.. yes this laptop is the best in this budget... i would like recommend it.. everything have pro's and cons hear my version of pros and cons  pro battery backup stylish and smooth look.. hd cam (i use skype alot) comes with free backpack  cons seems they dont have space for up and down keys and they adjusted them in one key space and it is soo annoying no keyboard led( this is a budget laptop though) mouse pad keys makes you feel you are using a china maid :P
52,31-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"Product delivered in a day, I bought this for around 25K. It is down to 23K now. Great value for money. Laptop was ready to use when delivered, All I had to do was login and start using. System specs are great for this amount. Overall great deal !!"
53,29-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"Flipkart Price always fluctuates. Purchased this for 24500 with free backpack five months ago. Pro:-  *Performance is best. same as i3 processor (here A8 cost 3000 less than i3). graphics is better than i3. *4GB RAM supports high end software's. As I purchased this laptop only for those purpose. *Full size keyboard. *Gaming performance is good. As tried several games only to test the graphics and performance. *Gives decent power backup. (5 hrs). *Free backpack is good (Original HP worth at least 500). *Silent. It not makes noise. Cons: *It comes with windows8. those who not comfortable with this OS may found difficulty also it takes more RAM than windows7 means less RAM available for general use. *No backup OS DVD provided. They not provide OS DVD. we need to take backup for re install OS. and it takes minimum 32 GB pen drive. If you not take backup before your system crash, you may loose your licences copy of OS and force to install pirated OS. *Glossy finish is not so good. It is very sensitive. even my small headphones may scratch this glossy finish. will stick decent laptop skin on it. *There is only single drive of 470 GB. (As I not divide those space in different partitions, working on software which require 300 GB hard disk space). Good to have different partitions. *Speakers are good but not Dolby."
54,25-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,Just one word awesomeeeeeeeeeee....... Yesterday i got my laptop and as usual flipkart packing was tooo good. Coming to the product this laptop will serve your requirement completly except for high end gamers. Believe AMD A8 processor is way better then intel core i3 which is quite expensive. I initially decided to go for i3 as my budget was 30000 but still i went for AMD A8 and i bet you it is best. Only drawback is the trackpad which is not up to mark but still it is steal at 24000.
55,24-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,3,This is not a robust piece. I bought from WS retail. Delivery was good but when u hold it in hand it feels I should not hold it too tight else it will break :p.. If u r rough and tough user then dont buy this for sure.  Otherwise its speed and functionality is good.
56,23-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"i have been using it for two and a half months now and i have shut down it only for nearly 48 hours till now. The only disadvantage is the cache memory of CPU which is 2MB whereas it's 3 MB in i3. But if you are looking for a Laptop under 28k, then you are not going to find anything better than this. Go for it."
57,22-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"on first day use it was awesome experience 1- keys are very soft 2-ui is very good and pre installed apps 3-laptop design is awesome like premium laptop 4-it does not heat up more 5-camera resolution is very good and has good features every feature is good in this laptop and also hats off to flipkart fast delivery must buy laptop,if budget is 20000 to 30000"
58,21-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"FIRSTLY THANK YOU FLIPKART FOR AMAZING DELIVERY..I ALSO THANK THE SELLER WS RETAIL... REGARDING THE PRODUCT:  BASIC AND DECENT NOTEBOOK WITH NEW GENERATION SPECS INCLUDING AMD AND 8.1.  PRICE IS REASONABLE..  IT WILL BE HANDY IF U HAVE ONE ...  I LOVE IT..!!!!!!  HENCE A FULL 5 STAR FOR THE TEAM, FLIPKART,HP AND WS RETAIL .."
59,21-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"The laptop was delivered the next day in good packaging along with a free HP bag. Kudos to flipkart for excellent service! I bought a HP G6 2005ax laptop in 2012 for Rs.34000(MRP) and now this laptop whose MRP is around Rs.26500. I will be comparing this laptop to my old G6 2005ax at the end of the review. Now coming to the laptop  Design: The laptop looks good and sparkling black. The keyboard is nice and spacious and feels solid. It is not at all fragile like other reviewers keep complaining about. The trackpad is good and mouse buttons work fine. One thing I do not like is that the charging port is on the left side but that is okay I guess. Another con is that there is no VGA port in case you want to connect the laptop to a non-HD monitor. There are two USB 2.0 ports and DVD drive on the right side while the USB 3.0 port, audio and HDMI port are on left side. There is only one slot for RAM.  Software: The laptop comes with Windows 8.1 which is a big con. Some people like Windows 8 but I think it makes everything more cumbersome. Placing shortcuts on the desktop is more cumbersome now. The only plus side is the fast boot speed(less than 10 seconds). However you are prevented from accessing the BIOS settings or boot menu and installing any other OS is difficult. The OS is confused about whether its a laptop OS or a tablet OS. It looks like a teenager facing an identity crises. Hopefully Microsoft has fixed this disturbing quality and Windows 10 will be better designed. Another big con is that the laptop comes pre-installed with McAfee Internet security which is awful compared to Norton internet security. McAfee constantly annoys you with pop up notifications and caused the system to hang at one point while doing a full system scan. Norton has never caused this much trouble.  Display: The laptop screen looks beautiful especially with Windows 8. However it is quite reflective as well.  Sound: The speakers are okay and not very loud. Unfortunately they are located at the bottom front of the laptop like DELL which I do not like. The DTS HD audio software provided is good but not great. Have to keep volume at 80% even when using headphones.  Performance: The laptop is good enough for most normal tasks. However don't expect much performance when playing games. Due to lack of dedicated GPU, the laptop does not perform well except in old games. I got only 20-25fps in Skyrim at lowest graphics.   Battery: The battery in this laptop is good and lasts a long time. I haven't really tested it but you should get about 4-5 hours usage even while watching HD movies.  Webcam: The webcam is not very impressive. Despite being labeled as a HD webcam the quality is just ok and good enough for video calls. I have not tested the mic quality yet.  COMPARISON: Comparing my new g049au laptop to my old G6 2005ax, I feel that HP has degraded since 2012.  Advantages of G6 2005ax over g049au: *powerful dedicated GPU *2 RAM slots *easily accessible RAM and Hard drive bay by removing one screw *60 days Norton Internet security *Loud and excellent Altec Lansing speakers  *Dolby advanced audio which was mind-blowing. Had to use headphones at 30% volume. *Better webcam quality despite being non-HD *2 USB 3.0 ports instead of just 1 *Trackpad off button *VGA port to connect to monitor *more cooling vents to dissipate heat *came with Windows 7  Many of the HP laptops in 2012 came with the above excellent features which are sadly missing in today's HP laptops. To get good features you need to spend above Rs.40k and even then they are not as good as their predecessors."
60,21-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"Very good laptop, if you are planning choose this. Very good screen display. Build quailty is good. You cannot got these laptop feature at this price."
61,15-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"I had ordered this laptop from flipkart and they took more then 2 weeks to contact for delivery. Even after two weeks they failed to deliver the product and when I contacted them again, they said product has been tampered and cancelled the order without my notice.  I wasted my three weeks as a waiting period. finally I had to buy this laptop from a local store and to my surprise it was about Rs 1500/- cheaper then the price shown on Flipkart.  Flipkart is no great these days !"
62,14-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,3,the laptop was been good with the specifications in this price. but after i have been using of one week touch pad is not working it was horrible. otherwise it will be good.
63,14-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,Used product delivered. I have purchased this product on 13th March whereas this product already registered in HP website on 10th Jan 2015.
64,13-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,its an awesome prodcut also flipkart is dong a geat job by bringing such a huge number of variety in the products and that too at the best price i love shopping from flipkart wonderful experience
65,13-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,got it last week.once again excellent delivery from flipkart  here is my review about the product- pros: 1.looks great with its glossy finish  2.comes with windows 8.1(a big advantage) 3.no need to install any drvers from internet  4.just press the power button and start working on it 5.some usefull apps already installed 6.the sound quality is really good  7.keys are soft and doesn't make any sound  8.the battery lasts for 5 hours 9.weighs less 10. The APU quad core processor works well with the 4 gb RAM .You can upgrade it to 8 gb as well. 11.doesn't make any sound.you can easily work on it i the night without disturbing others 12.doesn't heat up even after using for a long period   cons: 1.the track pad buttons are quite hard to press 2.the keyboard quality is not that good 3.they didn't give any CD with the laptop (only setup instruction manual and the warranty card)  what else you want from a laptop under 25k just go for it!!
66,12-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"After using it for a few months I could definitely say this is one of the best options to choose from, given the price."
67,10-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,Please Do Check..I Have Checked It for Around 15 Times..No HP Secure and Smile Offer..I Am Planning To Buy This Product..But The Offer In Not Available For This Model..Please Check Before Buy..Otherwise laptop is good...
68,10-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,I firstly bought Lenovo G50-45 Notebook which is of same configuration but it looks like a Case in square shape and It is not good in looking. Later changing it to HP I bought it at a very good price with same configuration and has a very good look with a glossy finishing in black colour. Good features with HP Bagpack & preinstalled Windows 8.1. If you want a good look go for HP and want Battery backup go for Lenovo. I guess it has a very slight difference in battery as well compare to HP. GOOD ONE..
69,09-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,Amazing product and amazing services by Flipkart and especially hats off to WS Retail. They have been promt and Bang-On on deliverying the laptop before the mentioned date. And as far as the Laptop is concerened it is really a worth for money buy. I am loving the features of this Laptop and i would also recommend my friends to buy the same.
70,08-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,Laptop is worth buying at this price tag. Loaded with all essential features which you require in day to day use. Not sure its a good buy for high end users & developers. Overall a good buy at this price. But one thing I must say is that Flipkart should work on its customer satisfaction & delivery system. Got my replacement after 2 months & that too when I delivered the old laptop on my own.
71,06-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"I am using this product for the last couple of weeks. Got this with an offer at 21090 effectively.  Regarding the laptop,  1. Performance : Quite up to the mark for daily works , no hangs so far. 9/10 2. Display : Decent. Viewing angles are good. I will say above expectation for the price. 8/10 3. Sound: Loud and clear. Although tonal quality is not the best. 8/10 4. Keyboard: Keys and touch pad are not up to the mark , although you can live with this. I have noticed the same thing in other HP laptops in similar price range. Keys are quite hard. The touch pad seems to have a mind of its own at times!. 5/10 5. Battery Life : Gives 4-5 hours normally, 2-3 hours with 3G data card. 7/10 6. Software: Authentic Windows 8 64 bit! And a host of other soft wares from HP. It would have been nice if HP has provided free Macafee subscription during the warranty period of 2 years. 9/10 7. Looks and portability : Quite heavy , but does not look thick for a product in this price range. Looks and finishing are above average if you keep in mind that this is a 21 k product not McBook. 8/10  Total : 54/70. Have to give 4 stars although in reality it will be closer to 3.8 stars. Would have been a real 4 star if not for the keyboard. However ,seems to be one of the best products available in the market for the price range."

73,03-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,2,Have ordered it on 25th Feb on prepaid basis. Today is 3rd march. No delivery yet. Distance margin of around 200km only from Delhi.
74,03-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"The laptop looks very fragile plastic made. Hp customer care a bunch of amateurs. The 3 years extended warranty at 1999 a big scam, flipkart send you to hp, hp won t give it to you, when you see the laptop you also understand why, in 10 months time it will brake to pieces. I am in the process to return it in exchange for lenovo. DO NOT BUY IT"
75,01-Mar-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,Overall it's good. Using more than 1 months. Little mouse pointer problem. No heating problem. It's performing very well while running 3 vm on it. Good on this price.
76,28-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"I purchased this laptop because of additional warranty, today is 28feb, And it's last day of offer, When i go to HP website( Which is mentioned in T&C) then i notice that my model number is no in the list of product model. Flipkart are you making fool of us? very bad experiance from flipkart."
77,24-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"I recommend this to everyone who is considering a laptop in range of 25-30k.   I have been using this laptop for around 4 months now and has never felt any lag or whatsoever. I use photoshop and lightroom 5, both of them are graphic intensive software and i witnessed no lag, the performance is quick and fast.   I wont suggest this laptop for heavy gamers. This laptop is just ideal for day to day activities and some graphic intensive work."
78,23-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"There are many bugs in this device .from day1 im facing the ""UR PC ran into a problem ,WE need to restart the system ""  error name:system_thread_exception_not handled"
79,22-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,overall its nice but i think its mousepad is not good. it is unresponsive many times. its sound and battery are quite good as i have used many laptop but this one is best for this price and specs
80,22-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"This product is really good and serves my purpose! Dear flipkart, please update your specs about this product as it does not have any VGA connector!! I wanted to connect this lappy to my projector with the help of the VGA connector but never mind, there are other available options... I am impressed with the delivery made by flipkart... I ordered it on a friday and it got delivered on a sunday of the same week!"
81,21-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"This is the worst experience with flipkart. Laptop was defective, when I call to customer care they are not agree for exchange.  They return with same laptop. Friends do not buy with Flipkart, go to other companies they are giving exchange and even  refund as well, with no questions asked."
82,21-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,Dont go for these AMD Processors guys.....I dont understand why HP is spoiling their goodwill selling these kind of dump pieces..
83,19-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,Device works good but facing some issue like whenever installing software or something it hangs for a while...But not a major issue.. Its because of AMD processor.. You can go for it.. Worth buying
84,19-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,i m using this laptop from last 4 month and i was buy it around 22K so its value of money . working of laptop is good but speed of processor is slow. otherwise display and dimension (size) of laptop is too good
85,19-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"Writing this after using it from 5 months, decent laptop...satisfies all ur needs ... A good utility laptop...with great battery back up of 5-6 hours"
86,18-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,This is the best budget laptop and with AMD A8 processer which is better than Intel i3 Processor. It will not let you down.
87,18-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"Pros :  1). Good price from Flipkart. Thanks to flipkart offered me Rs. 20500 2). Good response time 3). For home purpose it is good.  Cons: 1). Screen resolution is not good. 2). Hard disk rpm speed is not good enough 3). No unused RAM slot, so you have to expand memory by replacing 4GB RAM to 8GB RAM 4). RAM frequency only 800MHz"
88,16-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,Using it for past 3 months. Till date no issues. A8 processor is very fast. Only problem I felt having viewing angle is not so good due to lack of IPS display. Value for money.
89,14-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I am very much satisfied with this laptop.I brought This Laptop with Rs.24990 rupees.Beautiful slick design is the key for this laptop. AMD APU quad core A8 processor and 4 GB RAM is a unbelievable deal at this price range. Performance is as good as any Intel core i3 lappy. Preloaded windows 8.1 is joy to work with. RAM can be expandable upto 8 GB which is pretty cool. The laptop runs in a absolute noise free manner. About the cons, the build quality of the laptop is not that hardy. The display I found is a bit dull and PPI is less. So the text and images are not as crisp as they look in the the modern day hi resolution smart phones."
90,13-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,3,"I bought this laptop last week, when purchased I got a offer of One year free subscription of MS office, after I purchased laptop Flipkart customer care is not responsible for this.  So dont buy in flipkart"
91,12-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,Thanks flipkart for this awsome product....It is really a dream come true for the people looking for good config in cheaper price....good going.
92,10-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,3,Nice Product but build quality is not good @ this price . Flipkart policies too bad . bad customer care they are not responding properly .
93,07-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,I had been an intel user until now when a friend of mine suggested for AMD and the experience has been very satisfactory.I bought this laptop as I was tight on budget so I decided to go for a laptop which is one step back in current trend.AMD processor onboard is a bit low end as compared to latest generation i3 but believe me you dont need a ferrari over a regualr sedan when u arent riding through a superhighway.AMD offers best performance for the works and gaming for a laptop in this range of configuration.For a little cut in performance (which wont affect you in anyways) u get a deal at much much lower price( almost 10K) as compared to those having intel i3 .
94,05-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"A8 chipset was good than i3. Performance, display, sound quality was quite very good. Worth buying it :)"
95,05-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,Service is really poor. Item has not been on promised date. Firstflight courier is not updating the tracking information regularly. It is showing same status for last 5 days. I would never item from Flipcart.
96,04-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"Hi, I have been using this HP laptop for last two months and found good experience with working on it. It looks simple and classy and good in price as well. I recommend all those who want buy a laptop which would be value for money."
97,04-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"I just recommended it to my girl friend & insisted her to buy it. Must say its helped me to keep me words. Its a ""awe"" product. Quite a good experience. First time using AMD Processor & it had scored a decent score. Lastly thanks Flipkart for a well packed - prompt delivery."
98,01-Feb-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"Purchased in Jan mid week ..till now no issues . Compared AMD A8 with I3 4th gen everywhere... i found it almost equal in every aspect. AMD might have lost repo due to earlier processor versions, but the A8 is giving good performance.  Glossy look. Lightweight ( in the price range. )  Overall satisfied with the product. ..."
99,31-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,i cant use micromax dungle on this laptop.otherwise overall performance is good....heartouching................GOOD IN SOUND AND VIDEO.NOT PAINFUL IF U R USING IT FOR LONG TIME.
100,29-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,this laptop are design for normal work and normal gameing but when i used it this performance are very impressive bcz it play gta 4 and crisis 3 very smoothly   this m/c gives performance more then expectation
101,29-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"Got this at a discounted price of 22,000. At this price I cant accept more  Great for everyday use, although the battery could have been at least 6 cell.  If u are planning to buy a Intel core i3 lappy without dedicated graphics, go fot this one as it will save you around 5k easily and the performance will be the same.  I compared the performance with my friends Intel core i3 lappy and I realized that I made a wise choice buy buying this product"
102,28-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"This the best ever budget laptop by HP.Just perfect. sleek,light weight,stylish,sound is good,webcam is fine,good for gaming also. Pros: 1.Way better than 4th gen i3 processor laptops out there. 2.Amd Raedon R5 Graphics.fit for medium graphics games.  3.It never hangs even when you do heavy multitasking.Clockspeed :2.00Ghz"
103,25-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"This Laptop has got all the essentials. Processor performance is good (i cannot find any diff. from my friend's i3) Good Battery Backup (>4hrs)  For Windows 8, i couldn't find any labels on the laptop, or any identification. Flipkart, pls help me in finding the product key?"
104,23-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"First of all, its a very good service from Flipkart. The product meets all the expectations. Smooth and sleek product from HP. A sure shot buy if your budget is about 23K."
105,22-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,2,They keypad quality is really not at all good. It feels inconvenient to use it. Lastly the screen quality again sucks big time due to a 15.6 inch screen with low resolution. There are lags while watching movies on VLC. Dont recommend this laptop for college going crowd who have hands on experience on better quality laptops.

117,21-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"I bought this lap, and initially I was feeling really happy but in the 2nd day itself I found a small dot in the screen, it was a dead pixel. I requested for a replacement but flipkart told me they can't replace product of this much price. I don't know why they are saying that there is a 30 day replacement for defective product. finally I contacted hp and they replaced the display. I was really feeling bad about flipkart's after sales service. Features of lap with this price is really good. I was really fed up of calling flipkart customer care, every time when I call they tried to extend the date.feeling really disappointed."
118,21-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,I bought this to gift it to a friend and I used this to make some initial configurations. I was happy to see this perform much better than the core i3 laptop that i use for myself. The screen resolution and the speaker quality were impressive.
119,20-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,Delivered just a day before. Good delivery with decent packing. HP Branded Backpack is also there in the package.   I have registered the product and get the warranty and ADP from the HP site without any problem.  Contacted the HP customer care to create recovery disk before starting the use of laptop. The support from the HP is awesome.

121,17-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,The graphics have shared memory of 1.5 gb and dedicated memory of 512 mb. I have watched the videos of games played on youtube and it has enough memory to play good graphic games. Overall I am satisfied with the product.
122,16-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,it was guaranteed to deliver the this product within one day.  Disappointed by Flipkart's failure to deliver.
123,16-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,waiting for product on 2nd day after paying for same day delivery charges :( and response from customer makes it miserable. even after calling them thrice you won't get ur issue resolved.

125,15-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"It is my ardent request to you all who are planning to buy this lappy to only buy it when retailer is not sending it via First Flight which might turn out to be a last flight for you they have the most pathetic tracking system in the world they will not reply to your e-mail and in a nutshell you are not going to know where the hell your shipment is???so beware and try to get surety that they will not send it via first flight ..,,,,,,,,,, even INDIA POST is better then it!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
126,14-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,The laptop performs very well with windows 8. The build quality is good and the AMD A8 6410 is really silent. The could have been even lower (below 23k) considering the MRP on it (nearly 25k).
127,14-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,3,"Well after using the laptop for more than 20 days i can ensure you all that you can go for it... ! 4gb ram , AMD A8 processor is not bad for daily personal use. It's graphics quality is also nice compared to Lenovo and Dell. ! I think it's best budget laptop... U all can go for it."

132,11-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,This is most certainly a great configuration at this price . I have been using it for a few months now and the only issue I came across is the suspicious sound that comes out of hard disk . The product is under warranty and I am gonna get it checked soon.
133,08-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,3,"was excited at the price of the product, then later realised i should have spent a little more to get a faster machine. All in all, a decent buy nothing more."
134,08-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,Can anyone please tell me what is the Memory capacity and the graphics card series number of this AMD Radeon R5?
135,08-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,I have been using this product from last few months and till date I have no issues. Its the best product in its range. Comes with all required applications pre-installed and also a lappy bag with it. Very much satisfied with it.
136,07-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,2,It was really not expected from HP!!!  This is year 2015.... We can't live with 10 years back technology.. :(  Returned this !!!
137,07-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,Lappy is nice with good configuration. Display & key board is also good. Sound quality is very good. But is bit slow because of its RAM frequency is only 800Mhz. But over all nice product on best price.
138,06-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,3,"Good basic laptop. Good performance. Boots/shut-downs very fast. FK has increased the price from 24K to 25K last week. Probably looking at the many good reviews. But, the keyboard is an irritant. Bad design. The keys are very closely placed. There is so much unused space in this 15+ inch laptop, but has not been utilized properly. The arrow keys are so small, you either miss them or hit 2 arrow keys simultaneously. The prints on the buttons are very dull and small. The function keys are so small and the prints so minute, you need to see very closely to make out the print. You will also have problems with the ENTER, home, end, pgup/down keys."
139,04-Jan-2015,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"Simply awesome ! ! !,  1. I have been using AMD processors for quite a long time and found this product on Flipkart on big billion day sale and finally decided to buy. 2. I was amazed by the quality of packing and service by Flipkart and they never fail to prove that again and again on my every purchase."
140,30-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"awesome laptop in low price with best quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,.................................................................."
141,28-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,I checked hp site for great winter offer for extended warranty and this product is not listed. Please correct your information. It will be cheating with customer that you are selling the product with wrong information.
142,27-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,2,"I am not satisfied with this product ,Its very slow you cant work on multiple sites ,processing is very low which irritates me.Another problem is I bought this laptop on 23 dec and yesterday ..means on 26 dec I got a message on a screen that Error: We couldnt complete the updates, Undoing changes. Dont turn off your computer...I am really disappointed and want to return this laptop ."
143,27-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I am sincerly thankful to flipkart for giving good offer at christmas (ie 10% off via standard chartered credit card) I placed order at around 8 pm and received my laptop the very next day at 1 pm .  Regarding the Laptop :-  Hp laptops are much better compared to dell . Cost is almost 60% less , processor is really fast built quality is way better than cheap dell plastic , it comes with very latest windows 8.1 . i bought dell inspiron 3 years back at 36k windows 7 hb , compared to dell laptops of recent 2014 which are at 35k-40k this laptop is way better than them in terms of built quality, configuration and suits indian pockets !   Thanks to HP !"
144,26-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,It was delivered on time by flip kart with laptop bag and windows 8 installed. Laptop is running fine . speed is very good and Battery backup is also good.
145,26-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"Great product from HP.  Contains AMD's top o the line 6410 processor! Got it for 21,990 during big billion sale. It's well worth its current price around 25-26 K.  HP gives 1 year free onsite warranty which I'd to use twice as I downgraded to win 7, 64 bit.  Bluetooth is not working in win 7. That's my only complaint.  The bag, the looks are all awesome.  Use digiflip bass speakers for a home theatre experience.  Thank you Flipkart! That was one awesome deal!"
146,26-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,I ordered it yesterday evening and got it delivered withing 15 Hour...I will rate the product once I start using it.  Thanks Flipkart!!!
147,24-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I received the laptop in less than 24 hrs after ordering. The laptop is brand new HP with AMD A8 Processor (~Intel i3), 4GB RAM, Win 8.1 OS. Its a great configuration for my work. I did basic testing and found to be excellent.  I need to install the software needed for my work and test it further.I recommend to others."
148,23-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I bought this laptop only for about 17k and every penny is worth it. The battery life is amazing, keys are extremely soft, screen size perfect, lightweight compared to other laptops of this size and after using for about 3 months i can say if have hardly ever faced any lagging. Easy to load as softwares were preinstalled, volume is pretty loud and clear as well.Thumbs up for HP and Flipkart!!"
149,22-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"Good product/laptop from HP with decent features to use and keypad is also quite convenient. Moreover quite a good service support from HP has been given which was really helpful.  There were few lags like antivirus not given although it was communicated by Flipkart.  But overall Thanks to HP and Flipkart, 5 star rating for customer support given by HP."
150,20-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"Good product in this price range! Sufficient for most of the routine requirements (entertainment, work related, internet)! Not for gamers though! Good service flipkart!"
151,18-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"Got it on last month and after one month of usage,writing the review.Overall a good product.If you want a lapto for basic usage like browsing,storing conect,watching movie..go for it.Not fit for gaming or offical work."
152,18-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,best piece with good configuration at this price tag. fully satisfied. thanks to flipkart for giving me this laptop at 20k.
153,17-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"Guys,  I haven't used the same laptop, but a very similar model with the same processor and ran into loads of problems due to HEAT!  This chipset + processor + GPU generates humongous amounts of heat, which need a very effective fan and cooling pathways design to keep it cool.  HP laptops however, come with very low quality fans, that get choked easily, and also not enough cooling pathway inside.  I have seen temperatures of 98 degress Celsius, before Thermal Shutdown. FYI - I use the laptop on a cooling pad!  Another bad thing about HP laptops is that it is very difficult to open and clean the fan. You practically have to dismantle the entire laptop, before you can clean.  I have had to get two of my chips RE-Balled, and my touch pad panel has stopped working, because of HEAT Damage.  All in all, I will advise NOT TO BUY THIS LAPTOP."
154,17-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"At this price, you could not ask for a better one! Go for it! you wont regret. No lags, no great delay and with original windows! Got it at 22K"
155,15-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,Good configurations with minimum price (20000/-) only good speed and display with latest operating system WIN-8.1
156,13-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"Perhaps the best lappy @ this price. Bought last week after a thorough check of Lenovo, Dell and HP. HP is the winner at last. Its a steal at this price, just go for it blindly. Most of the positive reviews are true to 100%. Just ignore the negative reviews, with a WS delivery its a sure Winner!!!!!"
157,13-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"For this price, you can't get a better laptop. Amazing performance. I also got a laptop bag worth 1k along with the laptop. Top notch! Don't look anywhere if your budget is around 25k. And as always I'm very satisfied with flipkart service. Top Notch!"
158,13-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,product is good & fast delivery. packaging is also good & safe for the product. Only thing that is complainable is screen of this lappy is smaller.
159,12-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,laptop is good for watching movies porn \o/ music sharing but not for gaming .. no problems at all and i bought it for 23ooo
160,11-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,3,Can some one tell me how to activate MS office on this windows 8.1.I bought a laptop of this model which is working good but am unaware of how MS office has to be activated.
161,09-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"This laptop looks exactly how it appears on screen.  Video: The picture quality is more than decent. Viewing angles are very good with very good range. I could clearly see the screen from the sides  Sound: Not the best, but not bad either. You will not need a pair of earphones to watch videos  Battery: Lasts more than three hours on normal brightness. Would increase if the brightness is set to minimum,  Touch Pad: Great! I initially found it difficult as I was new to Windows 8. In a few days, I was able to understand the many tasks that can be performed conveniently using the touch pad  Keyboard: Layout is similar to most number pad inclusive laptops. However, at times felt a drag. Occasionally, the keyboard did not catch up with high speed typing. Letters miss out and I had to readjust my typing speed. I would just say that the keys need to be designed slightly better.  Performance: Very smooth. Boots and shuts done very quickly. Never faced problem with browsing, watching films, working on Office, listening to music, playing videos.  Software: Surprisingly light. Not preloaded with a unnecessary OEM junk or other HP heavy softwares, You will find all that you need, except Office. I realized that Windows 8.1 is better designed than Windows 7.  Built Quality: Not as rugged as most Lenovo laptops. It has to be handled with care. As with most glossy laptops, this one is also a dust magnet. Use it and put it back in the backpack. This way it stays clean.  Backpack: Neat and smart.  LED Indicators: You have three very tiny LED indicators on the left side (one for HDD, another for DVD and the last one for power plugged in). Adapter: Decent length (but there is no LED on it)  Heating: No heating problem. Used it for 4 hours nonstop without any drastic heating. Fan is very quiet and works efficiently whenever there is little heat."
162,09-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,I got this laptop at discounted price from mobile app. Delivery of device was on date. Packaging was superb and got HP backpack also which was surprise. Thanks Flipkart.  Pros of this machine:-  1) boot up time is less 2) nice keyboard  3) great speed 4) No Noise 5) No heating   Cons:-  1) Speaker sound seems to be bit less   apart from that I have not found any issues. May be with longer usage can unearth some issues.   My Feedback:-  Worth buying this machine. It's value for money.   This model is not available anywhere and is available on Flipkart.com only. I had done lot of search with online and offline retailers.
163,09-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"Purchased the HP A8 laptop on Sat 6th and asked for same day delivery as I needed one urgently for my work. As soon as I received and opened the package found the keypad was damaged - one of the keys had come out of the pad. Called up Flipkart right away and lodged compliant to get a replacement.   Flipkart called on Monday to again find what the issue was, explained it and was informed I would be contacted in 24 hours with a resolution. When 24 hrs crossed and I called back, was informed its 24 WORKING hours....Nice.....what I asked for express delivery now has to wait for 5 days before it would get resolved. It's already three days loss for me now and I'm sure it would not be resolved in next 2-3 days as well from the looks of it.  Very disappointing service Flipkart. I have always been impressed with your service and especially your return process BUT this time I am very very disappointed."
164,09-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"nice and very useful.Provide a relevant, unbiased overview of the product. Readers are interested in the pros and the cons of the product."
165,07-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,AMD A8 6410 better than I3. Go ahead and buy this product.Delivery from Flipkart was awesome and HP Customer Support prompt when I had an issue with the Cooling fan .
166,05-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,Yesterday we ordered this laptop and today in one day we received. thanks to flipkart for good services.Now about laptop was excellent for End users or home use i recommend to buy.
167,03-Dec-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"one of the best lappy in this price range A8 is very powerfull machine it is compared with intel i5 and higher.. love this, thanks hp and amd for this at this pricerange.."
168,29-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"It is well performance laptop and has sufficient re-installed Win 8 apps with so much space. Speed of Boot up is also good.  Overall, I see it as a nice choice with a budget of"
169,20-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"I purchased @Rs. 21250/- from flipkart. Good & quick delivery. First laptop has keyboard broken, hence replaced.  Pros: - Good battery life. Charges quickly. - Sound very good. Keyboard and touch pad may be problematic. - Within 22K you can't get any other model with this specification. - Good style & look, thin. Not as described in the picture, more beautiful. - New window look designed for the product. For me the opening screen is the desktop, not the tiles structure.  Cons: - Product is not covered under HP accidental protection warranty. Only onsite warranty. So if something is broken, then it can't be replaced. - System becomes slower with the use.  - Win 8.1 (CPU usage may go upto 100%) - No VGA port  There is one RAM slot unused. So if you want you can add additional 4GB RAM."
170,18-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"AMD & HP have really made a nice product when you consider this Laptop.  First of all, NO HEATING ISSUES WHATSOEVER. Even on prolonged hours of use, longest I went on this was a little over 12 hours.  Second, HP's build quality is one of the best that I've come across on laptops, NO FLIMSY HINGES (like Samsung) Third, Windows 8 & 8.1 runs smoothly on this machine as well as Windows 7, the drivers for which you'll find on HP's website. Booting and system resume are fast also."
171,17-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I have used this laptop for almost 20 days,   Laptop does not make any noise, i did not face any heating problem. Though i dont play games, but while playing Movies or coding( i am programmer) i did not face glitch. i can say its good performace. Sound is good.  Picture is though is not HD clarity but good enough  I am satisfied with the choice. Probably i will be AMD processor fan forever"
172,13-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,Got this during the Billion Day Sale. for just Rs. 16000... Had an amazing experience buying products with FlipKart.  Thanks Flipkart......................................
173,09-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I have brought this laptop on Flipkart Big Billion Day in only 20000 . Unbelievable price for A8 laptop very good configuration and multitasking for home use , gaming and sometime heavy software also. A8 500 gb hardisk, 4 gb ram 15.6 :). I could say best laptop in this category from Flipkart . Must go for it ."
174,09-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"First of all, flipkart service is unparalleled. Order recd within one day.   However, the laptop had defective LED screen with one huge dark spot in the screen. Immediately raised a replacement request. Was having concerns on how much effort would be required for getting the replacement. But the experience was much better than I expected.   Received a call from their technical team within 2 days. They tried to convince me to do some updates etc on drivers. I refused. My reasoning was if I had walked into a retail shop, I would have tested the product before taking delivery. Same applied here. I need a working laptop. The executive agreed and approved the replacement request. The product was picked up the next day and replacement delivery was given immediately. Appreciate the service and the turn around time. Amazing.  Now coming to the product. It is value for money. My reference point for this review is Dell Inspiron 1525 (2009 model with Core 2 Duo processor).   LED screen is bright. However, color reproduction is not very accurate. I had to do some adjustment on the color to bring it closer to actuals but still is not great though acceptable. Viewing angles are average - but is same in all laptops of this or even higher range. My Dell laptop which was bought for 50K in 2009 has the same viewing angles. But, picture clarity is very good.  Keys are soft but appear delicate. Not sure how long will they last. Trackpad is ok with matte finish but buttons are very hard to press. Body is plastic and doesn't seem to be sturdy. I went for the HP diwali offer with additional 2 years warranty and accidental damage protection for additional Rs 4000. Doesn't give confidence to take chance on this.  Camera is strictly average.   Sound is very good - loud and HD clarity.  Battery life is decent - 4+ hours and charging is relatively quick.  No heating issues at all even with continuous usage. My Inspiron heats up big time within an hour.  With RAM of 4GB and AMD A8 processor, I has expected the loading of OS and applications to be extremely quick. However was disappointed on that front. Not to say it is very slow but is not the quickest as well. Infact application loading (web browser, Windows explorer, control panel etc.) is slower than my Inspiron 1525 with Core 2 Duo.  Overall, at this price point, this product fits very well to the needs of buyers who are looking for laptop in this price range. Good picture clarity, excellent sound, decent battery life with Windows 8.1 preloaded - it will serve all the basic purpose and may be a bit more."
175,08-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I bought it for 21250.  Delivered within 48 hours. Kudos to Flipkart and WS Retail. Nice packing.  Everything as described.  Free HP branded backpack is of good quality.  Coming to the product, a sleek, light, smooth, noiseless, heat-less AMD A8 machine from HP at very reasonable price (I have checked the import price of this machine).  Windows 8.1 64-bit pre-installed along with HP support software (HP Utility Centre - helps to register your product, diagnose any problem and give info about the product, warranty and service) and McAfee Live Safe (1 month subscription). There are also other pre-installed applications.  AMD quad core A8 with Radeon R5 graphics along with 4GB RAM shows excellent performance. Perform multiple tasks without any lags (Performs better than my i3 machine). Plays FIFA 14 smoothly in full resolution. Quick booting and shutdown.  Good display. Viewing angles not bad.   Smooth island style full size keyboard and large touch pad with Win 8 gesture support.  Excellent battery. Gives me 5 hours on average use!  Go for it before the stock expires!"
176,08-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"First thing to be noted, lightning fast delivery, got the product very next day. To be honest, not a fan of hp, being skeptical while buying. IT PROVED WRONG  First thing the display of the notebook is good enough, especially the viewing angles and bright enough screen.  The keyboard is however not a backlit, well not a big deal for me though. keys are wide spaced, ideal for me as my fingers are fairly big. The power key however is not an led key. the power lights are next to the audio jack, weird location for me.  The mouse is really soft and smooth, especially with the windows 8.1 gestures and matte black finish adds a look to it. Sometimes it lags up but after a proper update of every driver its fairly smooth enough.  The DVD tray is however not a robust kind. Its delicate.  The 500 gigs hdd is fair enough for me, it comes with a single windows partition. I later shrinked the volume size and added to more partitions within.  4 gigs of ram, good for average use. However you can expand it to 8 gigs.  The processor is good enough of handling the system, i didn't expected AMD to perform so good. Its capable of running average games. I managed to run dota2 and it performed decent.  IT DOESN'T HEAT UP. I had a dell and i guess it could cook an omelette. :D  The webcam... Whatever HP calls it trueHD or whatsoever is okay for skype calls and so on.  The battery really performs good. 4 hours of usage and takes less time to charge. However i complete the charge cycles.  The build quality is whole plastic, which i don't like. Looks good but that nasty plastic feel...but then the price point.  Pre installed windows 8.1.. i suggest to update the drivers with HP support a software within.  Don't know how long will it last. Not like does the job for me, but I'M REALLY HAPPY.  PEACE."
177,07-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"Yes this is my first laptop after booting out my old desktop , Had basic requirement for running autocad / sketchup for a designer like me,this with the specification on paper looked an good try and tempting to go for it.  Pro - comes with original Window 8.1 , good built quality , ok display, very goooood wifi connectivity , very good battery amazingly it come for 5-6 hours and doesn't heat up.  con - not much only thing is very poor sound (bearable when u see the price you paid for this)"
178,06-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"I order this laptop from Flipkart and got the worst service ever, it took them 5 days to deliver the product which was of compromised quality. It had scratches between the keyboad and touch pad. I called the Flipkart customer care and raised a return request however got to know once the order is placed it can not canceled and the new product will take another 5 days to make it to me.  Which simply means they would take 11 days to deliver the product I order and not sure if it would be damage free or not."
179,06-Nov-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,hi friends..   When we give poor review about the product.. flipkart display that review only two days.. after that u never see that review in review field...

I've bee using this product for a while now and I am really happy with it.  Pros of this Laptop 1)Windows 8.1 2)4 Gb Ram 3)Quad Core Processor 4)Price  Cons 1)Battery. It gets drained quickly. 2)Screen is good but expected some more clarity. I've been using this laptop for watching movies and web browsing. I've not yet tried the gaming performance. This is a great laptop and people looking one for their leisure time uses, then this a perfect one."
184,30-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,Ordered it Yesterday and received within 24 hours great service from Flip kart   Laptop is smoothing fast and has no lags  Sound Quality and processor is amazing and Blazing fast  In this price you cannot get a better configuration than this  Simply go for it  Looks Elegant and Smart Sound is crisp and Clear  Typing from the same Laptop
185,29-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,Flipkart SUCKS with their delivery. My order of HP laptop was to be delivered on 24th Oct and it has still not been delivered as of Oct 29th.  I think Flipkart likes to take orders but is unable to fulfill the orders. I am sure my future orders won't be going to Flipkart.I am going to cancel my order of HP laptop and ask Flipkart to refund my money along with INTEREST!!!! why should I let Flipkart enjoy my money since order was placed on Oct 13th and still not deliver in timely manner?
186,28-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I bought this laptop at Rs. 22,500. This is a nice product with this price range. Runs smoothly with heavy softwares. I got parcel on the very next day. Excellent service by Flipkart once again."
187,27-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,Good speed even comparing with I3 4th generation. Runs High resolution games even more than 1.5 GB packaged like NFS and Asphalt.
188,27-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,"If you are not too particular about the Intel logo then this laptop is a very good deal. You will hardly notice any performance problems because of the AMD processor. It offers very much value for money. If you are not too particular about having Windows, then you may buy a cheaper version with Dos/Linux.  The laptop is good and there are no major drawbacks. A small set of negative points (but nothing drastic to not consider the laptop at all) could be:  1) The cover is a dust magnet 2) The arrow keys are very improperly shaped 3) The keypad is not good (compared to a thinkpad) and feels plasticky and cheap. The keypad is too wide and that makes it very difficult to type fast. Touch-typing is impossible. 4) There is a separate numeric keypad too if it matters 5) The bag that I got was a bit damaged which I noticed only after the laptop was configured, registered in windows store etc. So I did not ask for a replacement. It is better to check the bag too before you proceed with the installation.  I bought this laptop mainly (only ) for my parents and it feels very good for that purpose."
189,27-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"i am using this laptop since 3 days..i found no flaws ,except it is slow few times which is not a serious problem. Only con i found was it is not having a VGA port . Except these things the laptop was awesome and a best buy for me .I got it for 21,000/- but it is a 30,000/- worth laptop...it is simply a CHEAP and BEST thing you must have."
190,27-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,Compared almost with every websites but cheapest and best product ........
191,26-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"This HP product is real value for Money. I purchased it for 22.5 k. Product specs, performance quite cool.   While the seller WS Retailers has been meticulously fast in despatching the product on the same day when I placed the order on 17/10/14 it came to my city within 2 days on 19/10/14 but Chennai Flipkart this time also failed to give delivery for next 7 days and gave it to me on 26/10/14 by 5 pm. Product is surely recommended for all"

193,25-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I bought this for my son as Diwali gift. Laptop was delivered within 2 days just on Diwali day. My son was very happy, but when he switched it on, the system did not boot. After several attempts, we came to know that the Operating System ie., Windows 8.1 is not pre-loaded at all. My son's friend said it could be a hardware problem too. We called up Flipkart customer service and complained the same night. They said that their technical team would resolve the issue within 2 days, but so far no body called. I am totally dissatisfied. I want to return the laptop."
194,25-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,i am order this product on 16th November. till now i am not yet received. worst experience with flipkart

196,21-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"I bought this for 22,500, which clearly feels like a good deal. This laptop is not a great performer. Don't expect too much. Touchpad is not that responsive (only in windows, ubuntu works fine). Yet, this is the best entry level laptop you can buy right now for this price. Windows 8.1 and an impressive backpack really makes this deal great. To be frank, having a windows 8.1 is the best thing to have in this laptop.   Don't expect a miracle. It is an ""OK"" laptop, for a very tempting price."
197,21-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,4,does this cover india warranty?? does tis comes with the drivers and manuals and pre installed software??

209,18-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,I have purchased a HP Laptop from Flipkart and opted for Additional warranty + mouse + av package which is handled by an agency related to HP.  They are the cheats and didn't provide the promised thing and returned the money.

213,12-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,first of all this product busts all myths about amd processors. i have been running with it since the past week. i performance is pretty smooth. the only disappointment with the product is the speakers. they are faint. but for the price range and the budget of students this is a must.
214,11-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"Oh my Gosh...I got the laptop that I had been salivating over for more than 2 weeks at a HUGE savings...less than RS 17,000!! Whoopee!

216,10-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,I had ordered this product on the Big Billion day under exchange offer and must say it was a very satisfying experience being able to place the order without any hitch. I was informed on 7th Oct day the ordered item shall be delivered maximum by 17th of Oct and that I have to clean the old laptop and return it. Next day while I was out of station I get this message saying that the laptop will be delivered by evening. That moment itself I called up the Flipkart Customer care and requested them for the delivery of the item by Friday 10 Oct or Saturday 11 Oct so that I get time to remove the day from my old laptop. The customer care representative accepted my request and told me that the new laptop will be delivered by Friday (and they will take back the old one) Much to my surprise the Courier fellow landed at me house that evening itself. He was informed that we have requested for delivery by Friday. I again called up the customer care to clarify about the delivery and was told that this request to deliver on 10 Oct Friday shall be entertained. Next day 9 Oct I got the shock of my life when Flipkart sent me a message stating that the Order has been cancelled and I shall be getting the refund. On inquiring Flipkart Customer care representative informed nothing can be done now that the order has been cancelled. He further told me that I shall have to place a fresh order at the current price in order to get the Item  I fail to understand how flipkart can unilaterally cancel my order without my consent? I have till date had wonderful experience with flipkart as a buyer and I m more than disappointed about this incident!!!
217,10-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,"Dear sir, Pls kindly informed to delaying and not information details, so pls informed to shipping details"

219,09-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"Pros -   A very good laptop for its price. Has all necessary features, working in sync. Brilliant body finish.  Cons -  Keyboard feels too plasticky & fragile. That;'s about it."
220,09-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"Awesome Laptop. What a configuration. Stylish looks. this configuration is cheap for even 25 K. I personally do not like Windows 8/8.1 but I have heard all Licensed windows 8/8.1 will be automatically upgraded to Windows 10 by microsoft in a month. So, I am very happy with the deal."

Got a HP back pack as a surprise gift. Can I expect more?  Laptop is simply superb. Enough has been said about the specs by others.  As usual flipkart delivered in 2 days and picked up the old laptop while delivering the old laptop. Good job."
224,08-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,"This is by far the best value for money Laptop I have ever purchased so far.   The looks are stylish and sleek.   Specification-wise it is loaded with a A8 processor, a 4 GB RAM which is expandable to 8 GB with 500 GB Hard Disk capacity which I felt was enough for home usage.  It also comes with a Window 8.1 Operating System what with the suffering I went through with my old Notebook on XP."

228,06-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,I have placed an order and still charged the full amount. Where's my Rs.5000 exchange amount?? Further details to be added once i get the laptop.
229,06-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,1,I ordered 2 laptops on big billion day worth RS 16700 each... but after sometime i got a mail that my order has been cancelled... and the price of laptop shot upto Rs. 25000 each..even the customer care is irresponsibly hanging my call. I just wasted 2 hours behind this and got nothing...
230,06-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,2,The price was never 16790 but rather 18000 + as the ci and standard charted card offers can never be combined. It still was a good deal
231,04-Oct-2014,HP 15-g049AU Notebook,5,I dont know how Flipkart does it. Quad Core A8 processor with windows 8 on other websites starts from 32-35k!!! Even Flipkart is selling other Laptops with this configuration at much higher price. I think there is some pricing error or something. But nevertheless I took the advantage of it.. :)
232,16-Oct-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,"A good product from HP Compaq. Thanks to flipkart for delivering the product on time. I got this laptop at very reasonable price (25,100/-). I am writing the review after more than 3 months use.  Pros : 1.By look it's quite good with glossy finish. 2.battery backup is nice around 3-3.5 hrs. 3.boot time is quite low. 4.windows 8.1 and nice HD display.  Cons : 1. touch-pad is not upto the mark. 2. up and down keys in keyboard are very small.  But anyway really a very nice product at this price."

234,21-Aug-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,3,"I bought this laptop recently for my father. I got it in 26,000 INR after promotions. This is a Compaq branded laptop instead of HP one. Laptop is shiny gray in color, which I felt is better than the shiny black.   This laptop is exclusively available with Flipkart. I could not find this on any other website or offline retail store.   Product is looking good so far with responsive keyboard, Genuine windows 8.1 (no hassles of installing & finding drivers). Mousepad could have been more responsive. Screen is shiny n glossy. It comes in total plastic body (which is norm in lower priced laptops these days).   No bag or backpack has been given with this laptop.  All in all it looks ok for the money. Time will tell about the performance & durability."
235,26-Aug-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,4,"I bought this laptop after considering HCL/Dell and Toshiba in same price range (~30K)  Based on my almost three weeks usage I found it working to my expectation.Screen resolution is good.Boot time is very low and no lags oserved.  My only problem is the touchpad quality as many times it hangs or pointer moves without doing anything.I need to contact the HP first to ask them about solution for this problem other wise nice product with good processor/RAM and HDD capacity for general home use. No heating issue even when run on battery.Battery back up is good and charge gives alomst 3-4 Hrs for normal browsing,youtube watching etc.  One point less for touchpad issue other wise all in all it's good product."
236,04-Mar-2015,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,4,Just bought this laptop HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook (4th Gen Ci3/ 4GB/ 500GB/ Win 8.1) (J8C08PA) with free backpack and 1000/- off @28600/-. Was delivered in a day as promised for just 90/-. The OS was preinstalled and is OK. .THE BACKPACK promised is yet to be received..No separate CD for OS is given. The laptop looks great and keyboard smooth..Good experience...so far..
237,10-Feb-2015,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,4,"Could Haves:  (1) In this 30K laptop, screen resolution could have been better.   (2) Battery life could have been 5 hours - a reasonable requirement in today's time.   (3) Because user owns licensed Windows 8.1 with the purchase of this laptop, an easy way instruction of creating recovery DVD or USB could have been provided which will guide non-geek users to successfully format laptop and re-install Win 8.1 OS again.  (4) Screen panel hinges quality could be improved. It appears so jugaadu and fragile.  4 stars for HP Compaq Laptop with 5K discount given to me on exchange offer on old laptop. Otherwise, 3.5 stars for HP Compaq Laptop at INR 30K.  5 stars for flipkart delivery and customer support."
238,05-Feb-2015,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,4,This is really a good laptop in 30k price range. I guess it is only available on flipkart. Last 2 days i am using this laptop and didn't find any issue. But the only which is not up to my mark is Keypad. Keys are little small. but overall i am very much satisfied. Just for keys i am giving 4 star otherwise 5 start product.
239,04-Oct-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,"On a lighter side, if you are not buying a laptop from 'chor baazar', this will be the least possible price for this configuration you can get for a reliable brand Laptop. With the latest Generation processor and latest Windows OS, this is the best laptop in market and also only at flipkart. I bought this product 2 months back and I didn't get a slightest of the problems. Light weight, smooth touch-pad, attractive lid texture are add-ons to the machine.  Go for the laptop if you are looking for hassle-free working in office as well as entertainment at home.  Highly Recommended."

243,25-Mar-2015,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,1,"I booked this laptop on 8th March, 2015 and got a prompt and speedy delivery on 9th March, 2015, kudos to the logistics team.The product is simply superb and it performs above my expectations. However, at the time of booking I was promised that I ll be given a laptop bag free of cost and the same was not delivered. I took this issue with the Flipkart customer care executive and they were unable to satisfy my query. I am now a distressed victim who has just suffered deficiency in service. So advice to my fellow buyers to read the conditions associated with the product carefully as the offers that appear are very ambiguous.   Bottomline: Flipkart, please carry out your commitments diligently and promptly!!!!"

As the laptop was to be given to my daughter as a Birthday gift, I called up Flipkart immediately after ordering and requested that the delivery of all these items be overlapped on the same day i.e. 05th March to surprise her with this Birthday gift. As always in the past, the Flipkart - WS Retail - Ekart combo delivered all the products on 05th March and thus meeting the customer expectations / wishes brilliantly and I can vouch they can easily out beat any MNC on the deliverables ! Thank you ""trio"" for the great co-ordination !!! The packing was fantastic and all the products were ditto as ordered.

260,27-Jan-2015,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,4,I will split my review into two parts  Part 1 - Flipkart Service - I placed the order for this laptop on 19th Jan and received the product on 20th Jan.  - The product had an issue with OS. I raised a complaint with FK on 21st Jan. I got a call from their technical team on 22nd and was told that there will be another call on 23rd. On 23rd I received another call and was told that i will receive another call on 24th. Well.. finally on 24th the right person called me and I explained the issue to him. He promptly accepted the replacement and I received my replacement laptop on 27th Jan.  Overall I was satisfied with FK service.  Part 2 - Compaq - My previous laptop was a7 year old hp. I did not like the key and touchpad on the compaq - Battery is a simple 4 cell and lasts about 2 hrs - Ram of 4 GB is sufficient for browsing but nothing else.  Overall satisfied with the product as usage is very limited and this is used for family use.
261,19-Jan-2015,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,3,Today flipkart deliverd Compaq 15-s009tu its ni1ce looking & window 8.1 is good for it tjis is only plus point but there is some negative points  1) batry backup is low only 3 hours 2) when wifi connected lots of time its hang 3)some time its slow so todays my experience its average laptop on this range.

Good for everyday office and academic purpose.  My dad uses it every workday for at least 8-10 hours and it works very well!  We were struck with a Xp - Pentium 4 desktop, then this laptop was a major upgrade and it solved many problems. So we love this product."
265,04-Jan-2015,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,[I was really pleased by the delivery of flipkart. [first I was scared to give a lap online but after my few purchages in flipkart I believed and flipkart was awesome.the packing was very good. [coming to lap--its very good for home / basic needs. [booting time is very pleasing [only con is touch pad that lags few times during busy situations [the model is unbeatable with its stylish look and design [I don't go with specifications n price as u can see in website clearly [its a recommended lap for small budget and good specifications [I do suggest my mates to buy this
266,30-Dec-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,4,"I am using the laptop for 3 months now. Good quality build with overall good performance.  Pros: you can get from other reviews. Cons: TouchPad is really bad. Gets stuck, so I started using a mouse Slow at times but that is to do with Windows 8.1"

Well for this price I guess there is no room for complains.  Key board is not that great, you may want to take extra care with it... I liked the battery back up... 3 Hrs solid back up in performance mode..."
271,20-Dec-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,4,"Pros : Low Price for decent specification  Good looking, but all plastic body  No heating issues  Working silently  Great keyboard Cons : Touch pad issues, Resposiveness is variable  Bad display - Poor contrast, Colour reproduction, Poor Viewing angles  Loud speaker has low output  No VGA port, only HDMI output. Overall it is a good , reliable product on budget.Can't be a great gaming machine. Good for Office, Browsing, Entertainment."
272,20-Dec-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,Very reasonably priced and excellent laptop for daily use. Bought for my employees of a small start up company. HP offer for 2 year additional wty for discounted amount is also excellent. Worth a buy !
273,20-Dec-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,4,"I bought this laptop 2 months back. it is light weight , grey color is good. Worth for the Price. Great deliver. packing is good."
274,13-Dec-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,"i was hesitant to buy laptop from Flipkart, but after this purchase my fear went out of the window. Awesome product from every angle. The street price was more than 7k more than with what i got from here. With the warranty and 30 days replacement guarantee i got, there was nothing more i could ask for. Heads off to flipkart for such cool deals."
275,11-Dec-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,"Ordered on 9th Dec and received the product the very next day...amazing fast delivery! Thank you Flipkart!

276,28-Nov-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,"Hi Brought this LAP a month back @ 28500. After all good experience along this month, I am very happy to share my review. First and formost, This is the best ever LAPPY at this price and with unbeatable configuration.  Pros : 1. Stylish design, 2. Super lookings, 3. Flexible keyboard (with numeric keyboard, note that most of the lap's wont have it), 4. Faster USB port, 5. faster WIFI,  Cons : I didnt font any.  Final word: This is the best LAP in this range"
277,12-Nov-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,4,"After a long survey both online and offline and spending almost 2 weeks, Tons of thanks to Flipkart for delivering it a day earlier then as promised. And their it was the best laptop with Original Windows and a 4th Gen i3 processor. Its a sleek, decent, and daily use laptop with a reliability of the Brand HP.   Major feature of the Machine.  a. Sleek and Light weight (even after attaching batteries). b. Shinny glossy front. c. Nice dark keyboard with a large track pad (Ordinary thing) d. Orginal Win 8.1 e. i 3 processor for less than 28k.  Major Drawback.  If you visit to HP's official site you ll find that they also offer a 2 GB Nvidia 840 Graphic Card in this model but i think they have different configuration for Indian user. An other drawback can be shorter power cable (Cost cutting).  All together the system is good for daily use, and could be satisfactory for a rookie gamer."
278,02-Nov-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,4,"Go For it without a second thought.Amazing looks and so is the processing.!!!  No other Company is offering this configuration at this price range.  Nice keys, glossy looks, light weight, nice display, nice sound.  Only con I found till now is no backlit keyboard which makes difficult to work at night.  But no regret at this price range. !!!"
279,27-Oct-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,"simply i will say ""waoo"". what a product & quality,i have seached whole market but it was nor available neither the same specification what i got was available @ 27 K & i had fall in love with my lappy.Simply beautiful,as well as the flipkart packing is also too good,we can rely upon them but only de-merit is that they do not provide any free complimentary gifts such as laptop bag,mouse etc."
280,20-Oct-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,Nice laptop in 29K with  Ci3 4GB Ram 500GB HDD Win 8.1 nice battery back up with average sound which suits this pricing Using this laptop from past 7 days hassle free operation and not facing any issues.  And flipkart one day delivery made me feel wow.... Hats off to flipkart.
281,18-Oct-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,4,Was looking for a laptop and bought this one after reading lot of reviews. Best laptop for this price. Exchanged my old one and got it for a good deal. Go for it if you are looking for a laptop for day to day usage. Will not disappoint you.  Flipkart delivered the product in three days and as usual the packaging was great.
282,18-Oct-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,Even in Diwali time flipkart have delivered it on time.. Thanks to flipkart  The product is value for money. the laptop performance and speed is very good.
283,18-Oct-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,3,"I am happy with the offer price and quality of the product need to be used, i have got only 2 days before.   Delivery is too long,User guide manual is only given in a single sheet, not even a small book."
284,17-Oct-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,4,"Product meets a good spec, makes you feel happy for the look also.  The keyboard edges are a bit weak and will feel like material not very strong. Despite of these dissappointments, so far does a decent average performance.  Worth buying if you get this below 26K"
285,15-Oct-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,4,i didn't get separate OS CD its looking good and its worth fr money. but i don't like the Compaq symbol in my lap i expected HP on it i didn't get cash back still.i bought this before 3 months
286,10-Oct-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,Brought this laptop under exchange scheme for my old Compaq laptop. Just for 23k. I think at this price i cant get more then this.
287,04-Oct-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,"Bought a month ago and working really well. Earlier had some issues with touchpad but downloaded the drivers from HP website and after that it is working well... Apart from this, no issues at all.... Working smooth as butter."
288,04-Oct-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,Excellent laptop for the price. Glossy finish; excellent build and good battery backup as well. HP has produced a gem here at this price. I was thinking whether to buy Compaq but after looking at it and knowing it's HP's product with warranty/service provided by HP would advice others to go for Compaq without second thought
289,04-Oct-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,5,I have used Compaq long back and absolutely loved it. But later it disappeared from the market. I saw it on Flipkart and didnt think twice before buying this for my family. I must say I am not disappointed at all. The laptop handles the day to day activities without any load. The preloaded Win 8.1 is a boon for my parents who can't hunt for a OS. The 15 inch screen is good. I think and the look and feel of the body could have been better as i am not a fan of the plastic body. But cant complain at this price point.  Overall a good budget laptop for my parents. Thanks to Flipkart for getting Compaq back.
290,12-Sep-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,2,this laptop is value for money. delivered in time by flipkart. it boot up reasonably fast. No Windows CD inside and there is no Office software included.  the cons are the feel of the body is plastic and it slows down when antivirus scan is on. so far no problem seen
291,26-Aug-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,3,i needed a new laptop of cost around 30k . This is an amazing product . The only downside being the cheating nature of flipkart. The The mrp on the box of the product was 32k. On flipkart's site it was listed at 35k. After sale I got the product for 29k. Listing for 35k when the mrp is 32k of a product so as to give a false sense of satisfaction to the customer is very petty and cheap tactics by flipkart. This is not the first time that I was cheated by flipkart . It has happened on a variety of occasions. Please do check the mrp of the product when buying them from flipkart or other retailers .
292,21-Aug-2014,HP Compaq 15-s009TU Notebook,1,DELIVERY BOY WILL NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AND EVEN SHOW THE CONTENT. BUY ONLY IF YOU ARE READY FOR GETTING BLIND DELIVERY. ALSO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HP AND COMPAQ IS BIG MYSTERY. THIS SERIES IS NOT AVAILABLE IN MARKET AND NO BODY AT FLIPCART CAN EXPLAIN THIS. WONDER IF THIS IS OBSOLETE MATERIAL AND FLIPCART HAS BOUGHT OLD MODEL TO SELL IN INDIA.
293,28-Jan-2015,HP Compaq 15-s104TU Notebook,4,"Pros: WIndows 8.1 Genuine PreLoaded, TB HDD, High speed Intel Processor, 4 GB DDR3 RAM. Good performance, Sturdy looks. Videos and Gaming: Very Good Performance.  Cons: 1. A bit heavy but nobody is placing laptops on ""laps"" right? ! So this nullifies.   2. Battery backup could have been better. But with good quality adapter the charging time is less.   Overall:"

296,26-Jan-2015,HP Compaq 15-s104TU Notebook,5,Its the best deal as compare to other brands. Everything works perfect.

314,20-Oct-2014,HP 1000-1b10AU Notebook,3,well....these laptops have been given by rajasthan and up govts to their respective state boards students....only difference was that windows 7 came pre-installed.......  these laptops work satisfactory for some months only.......the AMD processor A4 is very weak.....even old pentium 4 work much way faster.....this is really annoying....  firstly i would prefer to increase its ram to 4gb.....  .and its keyboard its awful..  .this laptop would have been amazing with intel processor....like core 2 duo...or even atom.....or 2nd gen i3.......A4 will frustate you in the future......  and also please dont install windows 8....these laptops were never made for that...you can try and you will see....  however graphics card is good and you can play some pretty good games......but not to much as it gets hot very fast....  ALLOVER.... it is good who want to use it in a normal way....just for a time pass and document work......but believe me A4 will dissappoint you....
315,01-Feb-2015,HP 1000-1b10AU Notebook,5,"Hi All,  Best product to buy in the current market. first of all thanks to flipkart to the timing delivery and Salute to W.S.Retail for the perfect packing. They proved again that they are best sellers throughout Inida.   Coming to the product, Whatever shown in the flipkart images it resembles the same and glossy looks make you mad. Its just awesome. I have purchased this laptop for 15,750. Its worth for its price. Many told that the processor may lag sometimes but does its best til now. No issues till now. The display is too good for its price. The keyboard looks like cheap plastic but its fine. Touch pad is too good. Camera is ok. You never get better than this for this price range.   If you are looking for personal purposes without any high resolution games. This makes you live. Gamers dont prefer but the graphics is good only more than its range. Speakers are the best part in the laptop. Altec is so cool..!!  I just loved this laptop. One main reason i booked this laptop in Flipkart ""W.S.Retail"". The best seller. For performance i will give 4.5 stars."
316,25-Mar-2015,HP 1000-1b10AU Notebook,5,"I bought this laptop last month from flipkart. And thought to share my experience. I am happy with the purchase. Pros: 1. Superb look. Before buying this, I had a good look on set of models of different brands between this range. I must tell you, this one has no doubtedly the best look in all. The keys and mouse mover are symmetrical. 2. Price:You cannot get much cheaper laptop than this with the same or more better configuration. Hp is doing a super job.  3. I am in IT field and basically took this laptop for coding. And had no more expectation that time. But I must tell you this is a masterpiece. Not only good for coding, its good for playing HD graphics(movies), for using internet , sound is descent. Even for gamers, it can manage average games. 4. Very lightweight, you can carry it literally like a paper notebook 5. Expandable RAM 6. And most importantly looks very dependable item.Got just in 18k along with an HP bag. I am not surprised now after seeing the increase in the price.   Cons:  I feel very harsh to mention the cons and to compare it with next generation lapies. 1. Keys look very delicate. But we can have a usb keyboard so that is not an issue 2. Becomes hot if we put load on the processor for a very long time.(Mostly while playing ultra graphic games) 3. Free OS is dos. We need windows 7,8 cd to update. I have windows 7 64 bit installed and not facing any issue. 4. Its so glossy and shows finger stains so easily that we need to clean it in every two days  Overall : A super product in this range. Perfect product for gifting. to the loved ones. It is said that it is good one for basic use, but I think its suitable for all kinds of users  Considering the laptops ranging from 16K to 22K, I give this one 5/5 stars."

322,31-Jan-2015,HP 1000-1b10AU Notebook,4,I bought this product for 15741 This is really good price for this product. No heating or damaged issues my one. Working fine. If you need for daily work purpose then this is a really product for it.
323,30-Jan-2015,HP 1000-1b10AU Notebook,4,"First of all I would like to thank flipkart for their excellent support and service....  Now this is a very good laptop at its price range... Quite powerfull processor combined with 2gb ddr3 ram and 500gb hdd makes this a very good package... You can upgrade ur ram upto 8gb and the best part is it has two ram slot... (wrongly printed in flipkart site)....    One Drawback is that it does'nt have any bluetooth.... At 1st I was shocked to discover that but fine..no big deal.... so if your primary need is net surfing, ppt presentation, watching movie or some other similar task then this is the right choice for u..... simply go for it......."
324,26-Jan-2015,HP 1000-1b10AU Notebook,4,Same Feature like HP 431 only difference proceesor and Graphic Card But Processor Freq greater than HP 431
325,26-Jan-2015,HP 1000-1b10AU Notebook,5,"After struggling with my present home computer running on a Pentium 4 CPU, even to watch a youtube video without any lags was a hassled work and it required me to tweak lots of settings here and there for every task I did.   Considering my above scenario, this notebook has brought a big relief in terms easing my tech side and allowing me to do all types of general routine tasks seamlessly without anymore worrying about tweaking.   I advise users to install linux mint cinnamon 17.1 rebecca. Its very user friendly and all the functions works out of the box without having to install any additional drivers or apps unless you have any specific requirements. Just make sure you update the kernel and anything else that shows in the update manager to the latest version after installation."
326,21-Jan-2015,HP 1000-1b10AU Notebook,1,"After i received my product. I opened the packing and i pressed switch on button .System started but nothing was displayed on screen. I tried once, twice, thrice nothing happened. Then i put windows 7 CD and restarted. Same thing machine started nothing is showing on screen.After 2 , 3 trials some thing was visible on screen. I started installing windows 7 mean while screen goes off. I don't kw what is happening. I Switch off my brand new laptop. After some time i again tried installing windows 7. This time i was successful . I was very happy . After shutting down. i again opened my laptop. Same thing is happening. Nothing is visible. Now what to do.  Should i go to service center with a brand new one day old laptop. Now doubt the product was delivered on time as usual."
327,19-Jan-2015,HP 1000-1b10AU Notebook,5,"This laptop is a good value for money, I reviewed many netbooks and laptops and this turned out to be a laptop with the price of a netbook, I'm happy with it. It comes with a simple backpack laptop bag. The battery only last for 3 hours and unfortunately it doesn't have a USB3.0 port apart for that it's a great laptop for normal use."

358,04-Oct-2014,HP 1000-1b10AU Notebook,5,An A4 laptop at the price below 20K is more than what you can ask for! I was looking for a no frills laptop and my budget was 20K and i found the Hp 1000. This is just amazing! Its a simple config and A4 is definitely able to handle the normal day to day activities with no lag.  Moreover this is from a Brand like HP. The laptop looks premium and feels goof for a sub 20K laptop!!
